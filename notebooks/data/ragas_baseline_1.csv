In this paper, we propose an automated process to find and extract condition-action statements from medical guidelines.

3,Did the system perform well on low-resource languages?,"['A system for the 2019 Sentiment, Emotion and Cognitive State Task of DARPAs LORELEI project\tDuring the course of a Humanitarian Assistance-Disaster Relief (HADR) crisis, that can happen anywhere in the world, real-time information is often posted online by the people in need of help which, in turn, can be used by different stakeholders involved with management of the crisis. Automated processing of such posts can considerably improve the effectiveness of such efforts; for example, understanding the aggregated emotion from affected populations in specific areas may help inform decision-makers on how to best allocate resources for an effective disaster response. However, these efforts may be severely limited by the availability of resources for the local language. The ongoing DARPA project Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) aims to further language processing technologies for low resource languages in the context of such a humanitarian crisis. In this work, we describe our submission for the 2019 Sentiment, Emotion and Cognitive state (SEC) pilot task of the LORELEI project. We describe a collection of sentiment analysis systems included in our submission along with the features extracted.'
 ""These performed reasonably well for the English data. Among the submissions of the SEC Task pilot, our systems outperformed the other competitors for both languages.Conclusion\tUnderstanding the expressed sentiment from an affected population during the on-set of a crisis is a particularly difficult task, especially in low-resource scenarios. There are multiple difficulties beyond the limited amount of data. For example, in order to provide decision-makers with actionable and usable information, it is not enough for the system to correctly classify sentiment or emotional state, it also ought to identify the source and target of the expressed sentiment. To provide a sense of trust and accountability on the system's decisions, it makes sense to identify a justifying segment. Moreover, these systems should consider a variety of information sources to create a broader and richer picture on how a situation unfolds. Thus, it is important that systems take into account the possible differences in the way sentiment is expressed in each one of these sources. In this work, we presented two approaches to the task of providing actionable and useful information. Our results show that state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers can be leveraged out-of-the-box for a reasonable performance on English data.""]","  Based on the information provided in the context, the system did not perform well on low-resource languages.

We call the individual key–attribute pairs morphological attributes.An example of a sentence annotated with morphological tags and lemmata in context is given in fig:sentence. The task of mapping a sentence to a sequence of morphological tags is known as morphological tagging.A Joint Neural Model\tThe primary contribution of this paper is a joint model of morphological tagging and lemmatization. The intuition behind the joint model is simple: high-accuracy lemmatization requires a representation of the sentential context, in which the word occurs (this behind has been evinced in sec:introduction)—a morphological tag provides the precise summary of the context required to choose the correct lemma. Armed with this, we define our joint model of lemmatization and morphological tagging as: DISPLAYFORM0  fig:model illustrates the structure of our model in the form of a graphical model.'

1,Do they demonstrate the relationship between veracity and stance over time in the Twitter dataset?,"['We observe that the temporal dynamics of public stances can indicate rumor veracity. Figure FIGREF2 illustrates the stance distributions of tweets discussing $true$ rumors, $false$ rumors, and $unverified$ rumors, respectively. As we can see, $supporting$ stance dominates the inception phase of spreading. However, as time goes by, the proportion of $denying$ tweets towards $false$ rumors increases quite significantly. Meanwhile, the proportion of $querying$ tweets towards $unverified$ rumors also shows an upward trend. Based on this observation, we propose to model the temporal dynamics of stance evolution with a recurrent neural network (RNN), capturing the crucial signals containing in stance features for effective veracity prediction.Further, most existing methods tackle stance classification and veracity prediction separately, which is suboptimal and limits the generalization of models. As shown previously, they are two closely related tasks in which stance classification can provide indicative clues to facilitate veracity prediction.'
 'Therefore, when the supervision signal of stance classification becomes strong, the learned stance features can produce more accurate clues for predicting rumor veracity.Experiments ::: Case Study\tFigure FIGREF33 illustrates a $false$ rumor identified by our model. We can observe that the stances of reply tweets present a typical temporal pattern “$supporting\\rightarrow querying\\rightarrow denying$”. Our model captures such stance evolution with RNN and predicts its veracity correctly. Further, the visualization of tweets shows that the max-pooling operation catches informative tweets in the conversation. Hence, our framework can notice salience indicators of rumor veracity in the spreading process and combine them to give correct prediction.Conclusion\tWe propose a hierarchical multi-task learning framework for jointly predicting rumor stance and veracity on Twitter. We design a new graph convolution operation, Conversational-GCN, to encode conversation structures for classifying stance, and then the top Stance-Aware RNN combines the learned features to model the temporal dynamics of stance evolution for veracity prediction. Experimental results verify that Conversational-GCN can handle deep conversation structures effectively, and our hierarchical framework performs much better than existing methods.']","  Based on the given context information, it appears that the authors of the paper are attempting to demonstrate a relationship between veracity and stance over time in the Twitter dataset.
