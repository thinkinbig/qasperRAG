 'Then we we could annotate condition and consequence parts.

The paraphrased sentence conveys same meaning. So it became a condition-consequence sentence in our dataset. On the other hand, for example, we cannot paraphrase ""Further, the diagnostic criteria for CKD do not consider age-related decline in kidney function as reflected in estimated GFR"" to an if-then sentence.We also annotated the type of sentences based on their semantics: We classified them into three classes: condition-action, condition-consequence(effect, intention, and event) and action. Examples are shown in table 1.Each sentence was annotated by one domain expert and us (and the disagreements where less than 10 percent). Table 2 shows the statistics of the annotated sentences for 3 different medical guidelines.Model Performance\tHypertension, asthma, and rhinosinusitis guidelines and gold standard datasets were applied to evaluate our model.'
 'Other types of consequences of a condition in a sentence may help practitioner to find what is true about a patient. In this paper, we propose an automated process to find and extract condition-action statements from medical guidelines. We employed NLP tools and concepts in the process to achieve more general models.We define the task as classification task. Given an input statement, classify it to one of the three categories: NC (no condition) if the statement doesn’t have a condition; CA if the statement is a condition-action sentence; and CC (condition-consequence) if the statement has a condition which has a non-action consequence. For a CDSS, to determine both ""what is true"" about a patient and ""what to do"" with a patient, CC and CA statements can be merged to one category.There are limitations in this specification of classification categories. For example, guidelines may contain statements with a condition referring to a consequence in another statement. Or, we can see condition and effect in two different sentences: ""However, there are some cases for which the results for black persons were different from the results for the general population (question 3, evidence statements 2, 10, and 17).']","  Based on the provided context information, an example of a condition-action pair is:

 'The comparison is reported in terms of LAS.

Thus, the reported numbers are not directly comparable, but keeping in mind the similarities of SD and UD annotation schemes, give a ballpark estimate of human performance in the task.

These findings raise the question whether it would be possible to realize similar advantages for other languages that currently lack dedicated models of this type. It is likely that the feasibility of training high quality deep transfer learning models hinges on the availability of pretraining data.As of this writing, Finnish ranks 24th among the different language editions of Wikipedia by article count, and 25th in Common Crawl by page count.

7,What does the cache consist of?,"['$T_D$ may need to copy some states from $T_P$ if we need to update information for those states in $T_P$.In order to support this mechanism, we use a two-layered cached FST for decoding. The first layer is public cache which represents $T_P$. It is a static cache created by pre-initialization. The second layer is the private cache, which is owned by a particular user and constructed on-the-fly. Figure FIGREF9 shows the architecture of our two-layer FST. The solid box denotes the static graph and the dashed ones show the dynamic graph. Personalized states will appear only in $T_D$.The static public cache stores the most frequent states, which greatly reduces the run time factor (RTF) of online decoding. Since $T_D$ has a smaller size than a fully dynamic graph, the marginal memory efficiency for multi-threaded service will be better.Furthermore, the private cache will not be freed after decoding a single utterance. The lifetime of a private cache actually can last for the entire dialog section for a specific user.'
 'The lifetime of a private cache actually can last for the entire dialog section for a specific user. The private cache keeps updating during the dialog session, making processing the subsequent utterances faster as more states are composed and stored in $T_D$. With this accumulated dynamic cache, a longer dialog can expect a better RTF in theory. In general, the static public cache serves all threads, while the private cache boosts the performance within a dialog session. The private cache will be freed at the end of the dialog.Architecture and Algorithm ::: Pre-composition algorithm for class language models\tBased on the algorithm described in BIBREF3, we allow the states $(q_1, q_2)$ such that $q_2 = (q_c, q_p), q_c \\in Q_c, q_p=0 $ to be pre-composed, where $q_c$ and $q_p$ denote states in $G_c$ and $G_p$, respectively.'
 'This one-time cost calculation can do some composition in advance. During decoding search, the FST will skip the composition of pre-initialized states. However, extending this algorithm to class LMs is non-trivial in practice. For a class LM, the non-terminal states cannot be composed during pre-initialization since we need a pre-initialization that is applicable to all users, which means we need to apply some restrictions to prevent composition of the personalized part.We define $T_P$ as a partial composed FST structure for $T=T_1 \\circ T_2$, where $P \\subseteq Q$ is the set of pre-composed states. In real time decoding, the on-the-fly composition will be performed on top of the pre-initialized $T_P$, which is similar to previous work BIBREF3.

We also propose two simple yet effective pre-initialization methods, one based on breadth-first search, and another based on a data-driven exploration of decoder states using previous utterances. Experiments with a calling speech recognition task using a personalized contact list demonstrate that the proposed public cache reduces decoding time by factor of three compared to decoding without pre-initialization. Using the private cache provides additional efficiency gains, reducing the decoding time by a factor of five.\tIntroduction\tSpeech input is now a common feature for smart devices.

As denoted in Eq (DISPLAY_FORM1), in a dynamic WFST decoder, $HCL$ is composed and optimized offline, while $G$ is composed on the fly with lazy (on-demand) composition, denoted as $\\circ $.To handle dynamic entities, a class LM $G_c$ is normally used as background $G$ and a personalized LM $G_p$ is replaced on-the-fly, before applying lazy composition.Since the non-terminal states are composed on-the-fly, it means the states of recognition FST will also contain personalized information that cannot be used by other users or service threads.In previous work, a method was proposed to do a pre-initialized composition for a non-class LM BIBREF3. However, it the dynamic part is still expanded on-the-fly.']","  Based on the given context information, a personalized language model refers to a language model that is tailored to a specific user's preferences, interests, and usage patterns. It is designed to improve the recognition of entities that are unique to the user, such as names from a contact list, locations, or music titles.

 'We apply gradient clipping with a maximum gradient norm of 5.Baselines (and Related Work)\tWe compare our approach against recent competing methods that report results on UD datasets.The current state of the art is held by N18-1126, who, as discussed in sec:introduction, provide a direct context-to-lemma approach, avoiding the use of morphological tags. We remark that N18-1126 assume a setting where lemmata are annotated at the token level, but morphological tags are not available; we contend, however, that such a setting is not entirely realistic as almost all corpora annotated with lemmata at the token level include morpho-syntactic annotation, including the vast majority of the UD corpora. Thus, we do not consider it a stretch to assume the annotation of morphological tags to train our joint model.Our next baseline is the UDPipe system of K17-3009. Their system performs lemmatization using an averaged perceptron tagger that predicts a (lemma rule, UPOS) pair.'

We select the best INLINEFORM1 for each language based on the development set.In fig:error-analysis, we provide a language-wise breakdown of the performance of our model and the model of N18-1126. Our strongest improvements are seen in Latvian, Greek and Hungarian. When measuring performance solely over unseen inflected forms, we achieve even stronger gains over the baseline method in most languages. This demonstrates the generalization power of our model beyond word forms seen in the training set. In addition, our accuracies on ambiguous tokens are also seen to be higher than the baseline on average, with strong improvements on highly inflected languages such as Latvian and Russian. Finally, on seen unambiguous tokens, we note improvements that are similar across all languages.Error Patterns\tWe attempt to identify systematic error patterns of our model in an effort to motivate future work. For this analysis, we compare predictions of our model and the gold lemmata on three languages with the weakest absolute performance: Estonian, Latvian and Arabic.'
 'Empirically, we have shown that our model achieves state-of-the-art results, hinting that explicitly modeling morphological tags is a more effective manner for modeling context. In addition to strong numbers, we tried to explain when and why our model does better. Specifically, we show a significant correlation between our scores and the number of tokens and tags present in a treebank. We take this to indicate that our method improves performance more for low-resource languages as well as morphologically rich languages.Acknowledgments\tWe thank Toms Bergmanis for his detailed feedback on the accepted version of the manuscript.

 ""The suffix -ma in Estonian is used to indicate the infinitive form of verbs. Gold lemmata for verbs in Estonian are marked in their infinitive forms whereas our system predicts the stems of these verbs instead. These inflected forms are usually ambiguous and we believe that the model doesn't generalize well to different form-lemma pairs, partly due to fewer training data available for Estonian. This is an example of an error pattern that could be corrected using improved morphological information about the tokens. Finally, in Arabic, we find that the most common error pattern corresponds to a single ambiguous word form, 'an , which can be lemmatized as 'anna (like “that” in English) or 'an (like “to” in English) depending on the usage of the word in context. The word 'anna must be followed by a nominal sentence while 'an is followed by a verb. Hence, models that can incorporate rich contextual information would be able to avoid such errors.Why our model performs better?\tSimply presenting improved results does not entirely satiate our curiosity: we would also like to understand why our model performs better.""]","  Based on the given context information, the researchers experimented with 20 languages in their study.","['They experiment with: arabic' ' basque' ' croatian' ' dutch' ' estonian'

To do so, we cast the problem as multitask learning (MTL). First, we show that adding a parsing paradigm as an auxiliary loss consistently improves the performance on the other paradigm. Secondly, we explore an MTL sequence labeling model that parses both representations, at almost no cost in terms of performance and speed.

We can observe that the stances of reply tweets present a typical temporal pattern “$supporting\\rightarrow querying\\rightarrow denying$”. Our model captures such stance evolution with RNN and predicts its veracity correctly. Further, the visualization of tweets shows that the max-pooling operation catches informative tweets in the conversation. Hence, our framework can notice salience indicators of rumor veracity in the spreading process and combine them to give correct prediction.Conclusion\tWe propose a hierarchical multi-task learning framework for jointly predicting rumor stance and veracity on Twitter. We design a new graph convolution operation, Conversational-GCN, to encode conversation structures for classifying stance, and then the top Stance-Aware RNN combines the learned features to model the temporal dynamics of stance evolution for veracity prediction. Experimental results verify that Conversational-GCN can handle deep conversation structures effectively, and our hierarchical framework performs much better than existing methods.'
 'We observe that the temporal dynamics of public stances can indicate rumor veracity. Figure FIGREF2 illustrates the stance distributions of tweets discussing $true$ rumors, $false$ rumors, and $unverified$ rumors, respectively. As we can see, $supporting$ stance dominates the inception phase of spreading. However, as time goes by, the proportion of $denying$ tweets towards $false$ rumors increases quite significantly. Meanwhile, the proportion of $querying$ tweets towards $unverified$ rumors also shows an upward trend. Based on this observation, we propose to model the temporal dynamics of stance evolution with a recurrent neural network (RNN), capturing the crucial signals containing in stance features for effective veracity prediction.Further, most existing methods tackle stance classification and veracity prediction separately, which is suboptimal and limits the generalization of models. As shown previously, they are two closely related tasks in which stance classification can provide indicative clues to facilitate veracity prediction.'
 ""Intuitively, a tweet's nearer neighbors in its conversation thread are more informative than farther neighbors because the replying relationships of them are closer, and their stance expressions can help classify the stance of the center tweet (e.g., in Figure FIGREF1, tweets “1”, “4” and “5” are the one-hop neighbors of the tweet “2”, and their influences on predicting the stance of “2” are larger than that of the two-hop neighbor “3”). To achieve this, we represent both tweet contents and conversation structures into a latent space using a graph convolutional network (GCN) BIBREF15, aiming to learn stance feature for each tweet by aggregating its neighbors' features. Compared with the sequential and temporal based methods, our aggregation based method leverages the intrinsic structural property in conversations to learn tweet representations.After determining the stances of people's reactions, another challenge is how we can utilize public stances to predict rumor veracity accurately.

We use a random sample of 5000 sentences from the test set of WikiText-103 BIBREF20 and a random sample of 5000 sentences from TBC as references.We also evaluate the perplexity of a trained language model on the generations as a rough proxy for fluency. Specifically, we use the Gated Convolutional Language Model BIBREF21 pretrained on WikiText-103.Following BIBREF22 , we compute self-BLEU: for each generated sentence, we compute BLEU treating the rest of the sentences as references, and average across sentences.'
 'Self-BLEU measures how similar each generated sentence is to the other generations; high self-BLEU indicates that the model has low sample diversity.We also evaluate the percentage of $n$ -grams that are unique, when compared to the original data distribution and within the corpus of generations. We note that this metric is somewhat in opposition to BLEU between generations and data, as fewer unique $n$ -grams implies higher BLEU.We use the non-sequential sampling scheme, as empirically this led to the most coherent generations. We show generations from the sequential sampler in Table 4 in the appendix. We compare against generations from a high-quality neural language model, the OpenAI Generative Pre-Training Transformer BIBREF23 , which was trained on TBC and has approximately the same number of parameters as the base configuration of BERT.

Thus, identifying radical content online is crucial to limit the reach and spread of the extremist narrative. In this paper, our aim is to identify measures to automatically detect radical content in social media. We identify several signals, including textual, psychological and behavioural, that together allow for the classification of radical messages. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) we analyze propaganda material published by extremist groups and create a contextual text-based model of radical content, (2) we build a model of psychological properties inferred from these material, and (3) we evaluate these models on Twitter to determine the extent to which it is possible to automatically identify online radical tweets. Our results show that radical users do exhibit distinguishable textual, psychological, and behavioural properties.

This relates to how active the user is in interacting with other users and how much attention they receive from their community. This links to the objectives of those radical users in spreading their ideologies and reaching out to potential like-minded people. As for the INLINEFORM0 category, we find that the use of word2vec embedding improves the performance in comparison with using the tf-idf features. Additionally, all bi-grams and tri-grams features did not contribute much to the classification; only uni-grams did. This can be related to the differences in the writing styles when constructing sentences and phrases in articles and in the social media context (especially given the limitation of the number of words allowed by the Twitter platform).

 'Imitation learning BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , though also exploiting metrics, requires access to an expert policy, with exact policies not directly computable for the metrics of interest.In this work, we aim at combining the best of both worlds by proposing a simple method that can turn popular coreference evaluation metrics into differentiable functions of model parameters. As we show, this function can be computed recursively using scores of individual local decisions, resulting in a simple and efficient estimation procedure. The key idea is to replace non-differentiable indicator functions (e.g. the member function INLINEFORM0 ) with the corresponding posterior probabilities ( INLINEFORM1 ) computed by the model. Consequently, non-differentiable functions used within the metrics (e.g. the set size function INLINEFORM2 ) become differentiable ( INLINEFORM3 ). Though we assume that the scores of the underlying statistical model can be used to define a probability model, we show that this is not a serious limitation.'

 'The issue of domain definition is overcome by the use of IR techniques which use the characteristic vocabulary of the domain to query a Lucene search engine over the entire corpus. The candidate sentences are defined based on word overlap and the decision whether a sentence pair is parallel or not using the maximum entropy classifier. The difference in the BLEU scores between out of domain and domain-specific translation is proved clearly using the word embeddings from characteristic vocabulary extracted using the extracted additional bitexts. BIBREF2 ( BIBREF2 ) extract parallel sentences without the use of a classifier. Target language candidate sentences are found using the translation of source side comparable corpora. Sentence tail removal is used to strip the tail parts of sentence pairs which differ only at the end. This, along with the use of parallel sentences enhanced the BLEU score and helped to determine if the translated source sentence and candidate target sentence are parallel by measuring the word and translation error rate. This method succeeds in eliminating the need for domain specific text by using the target side as a source of candidate sentences.'

We experimented with two scenarios: (i) supervised learning, where labels for trolls are provided, and (ii) distant supervision, where such labels are not available, and we rely on more common labels for news outlets cited by the trolls. Technically, we leveraged the community structure and the text of the messages in the online social network of trolls represented as a graph, from which we extracted several types of representations, i.e., embeddings, for the trolls.'
 'Thus, any supervised machine learning approach would fall short of being a fully automated solution to our initial problem.A more realistic scenario assumes that labels for troll accounts are not available. In this case, we need to use some external information in order to learn a labeling function. Indeed, we leverage more persistent entities and their labels: news media. We assume a learning scenario with distant supervision where labels for news media are available. By combining these labels with a citation graph from the troll accounts to news media, we can infer the final labeling on the accounts themselves without any need for manual labeling.One advantage of using distant supervision is that we can get insights about the behavior of a newly-discovered troll farm quickly and effortlessly. Differently from troll accounts in social media, which usually have a high churn rate, news media accounts in social media are quite stable. Therefore, the latter can be used as an anchor point to understand the behavior of trolls, for which data may not be available.We rely on embeddings extracted from social media.'
 'We show that even by hiding the labels from the ML algorithm, we can recover 78.5% of the correct labels.The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:We predict the political role of Internet trolls (left, news feed, right) in a realistic, unsupervised scenario, where labels for the trolls are not available, and which has not been explored in the literature before.We propose a novel distant supervision approach for this scenario, based on graph embeddings, BERT, and label propagation, which projects the more-commonly-available labels for news media onto the trolls who cited these media.We improve over the state of the art in the traditional, fully supervised setting, where training labels are available.Related Work ::: Trolls and Opinion Manipulation\tThe promise of social media to democratize content creation BIBREF3 has been accompanied by many malicious attempts to spread misleading information over this new medium, which quickly got populated by sockpuppets BIBREF4, Internet water army BIBREF5, astroturfers BIBREF6, and seminar users BIBREF7.']","  Based on the provided context information, labels for trolls can be obtained through distant supervision, where more common labels for news outlets cited by the trolls are used to infer the final labeling on the accounts without any need for manual labeling.

 'Indeed, the results for T2 are lower compared to their T1 counterparts by only 10 and 20 points absolute in terms of accuracy and F1, respectively. This is impressive considering that the models for T2 have no access to labels for troll users.Looking at individual features, for both T1 and T2, the embeddings from U2M outperform those from U2H and from BERT. One possible reason is that the U2M graph is larger, and thus contains more information. It is also possible that the social circle of a troll user is more indicative than the hashtags they used. Finally, the textual content on Twitter is quite noisy, and thus the BERT embeddings perform slightly worse when used alone.All our models with a single type of embedding easily outperform the model of BIBREF2.'

57,"Do they attempt to jointly learn connectives, arguments, senses and non-explicit identiifers end-to-end?","['The connective itself is a very good feature because discourse connective almost determine senses. So we train an explicit classifier using simple but effective features.Non-explicit Identifier\tThe non-explicit relation is the relation between adjacent sentences in same para-graph. So we just check adjacent sentences which don’t form explicit relation and then label them with non-explicit relation or nothing. In the experiment, we find that the two arguments of non-explicit relation have association with each other and also have some common words. So we introduce feature words, which indicate appear-ance of relation, like “it, them”.Experiments\tIn our experiments, we make use of the Section 02-21 in the PDTB as training set, Section 22 as testing set. All of components adopt maximum entropy model. In order to evaluate the performance of the discourse parser, we compare it with other approaches: (1) Baseline_1, which applies the probability information. The connective identifier predicts the connective according the frequency of the connec-tive in the train set.'
 'Next, each component of the parser will be described in detail. Connective Identifier\tThe main duty of this component is disambiguate the connective words which are in PDTB predefined set. Pitler and Nenkova citePitlerN09 show that syntactic features are very useful on disambiguate discourse connective, so we adopt these syntactic fea-tures as part of our features. Ziheng Lin et al. LinKN09 show that a connective’s context and part-of-speech (POS) gives a very strong indication of discourse usage. The table 1 shows the feature we use.Arguments Identifier\tOn this step, we adopt the head-based thinking BIBREF12 , which turns the problem of identifying arguments of discourse connective into identifying the head and end of the arguments. First, we need to extract the candidates of arguments.'
 'The sense classifier labels the dis-course relation. The non-explicit identifier checks all the pair of adjacent sentences. If the non-explicit identifier indentifies the pair of sentences as non-explicit relation, it will label it the relation sense. Though many research work BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 are committed to the shallow discourse parsing field, all of them are focus on the subtask of parsing only rather than the whole parsing process. Given all that, a full shallow discourse parser framework is proposed in our paper to turn the free text into discourse relations set.

The paper describes a pipeline-based approach where each component of the parser is described separately, and the features used for each component are distinct.

The connective identifier uses syntactic features to disambiguate connective words, while the arguments identifier uses head-based thinking to identify the head and end of the arguments. The sense classifier labels the discourse relation based on the input from the previous components. Finally, the non-explicit identifier checks all pairs of adjacent sentences and labels them with the relation sense if they form an explicit relation.

Self-attention is able to model long-term dependencies, but it may suffer from the extraction of irrelevant information in the context. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel model called \\textbf{Explicit Sparse Transformer}. Explicit Sparse Transformer is able to improve the concentration of attention on the global context through an explicit selection of the most relevant segments. Extensive experimental results on a series of natural language processing and computer vision tasks, including neural machine translation, image captioning, and language modeling, all demonstrate the advantages of Explicit Sparse Transformer in model performance. We also show that our proposed sparse attention method achieves comparable or better results than the previous sparse attention method, but significantly reduces training and testing time. For example, the inference speed is twice that of sparsemax in Transformer model. Code will be available at \\url{this https URL}\tIntroduction\tUnderstanding natural language requires the ability to pay attention to the most relevant information.'
 'The masking functions $\\mathcal {M}(\\cdot , \\cdot )$ is illustrated as follows:With the top-$k$ selection, the high attention scores are selected through an explicit way. This is different from dropout which randomly abandons the scores. Such explicit selection can not only guarantee the preservation of important components, but also simplify the model since $k$ is usually a small number such as 8, detailed analysis can be found in SECREF28. The next step after top-$k$ selection is normalization:where $A$ refers to the normalized scores. As the scores that are smaller than the top k largest scores are assigned with negative infinity by the masking function $\\mathcal {M}(\\cdot , \\cdot )$, their normalized scores, namely the probabilities, approximate 0. We show the back-propagation process of Top-k selection in SECREF50. The output representation of self-attention $C$ can be computed as below:The output is the expectation of the value following the sparsified distribution $A$. Following the distribution of the selected components, the attention in the Explicit Sparse Transformer model can obtain more focused attention.'

72,How is intent annotated?,"[""On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal.In the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme.""
 'All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold).For specific tasks, we also design a semantic slot annotation scheme for annotating sentences based on their semantic content. We identify 13 main semantic slots in the anti-scam task, for example, credit card numbers. We present a detailed semantic slot annotation in Table TABREF3. Following BIBREF1, we segment each conversation turn into single sentences and then annotate each sentence rather than turns.Datasets\tWe test our approach on two non-collaborative task datasets: the AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1.'
 'Then we compare the predicted values with human-annotated ground truth in the dataset to compute the response-intent prediction (RIP) and response-slot prediction (RSP).Extended Response-Intent Prediction (ERIP) $\\&$ Extended Response-Slot Prediction (ERSP) With Response-Intent Prediction, we verify the predicted intents to evaluate the coherence of the dialog. However, the real mapping between human-intent and system-intent is much more complicated as there might be multiple acceptable system-intents for the same human-intent. Therefore, we also design a metric to evaluate if the predicted system-intent is in the set of acceptable intents. Specifically, we estimate the transition probability $p(I_i|I_j)$ by counting the frequency of all the bi-gram human-intent and system-intent pairs in the training data. During the test stage, if the predicted intent matches the ground truth, we set the score as 1, otherwise we set the score as $p(I_{predict}|I_i)$ where $I_i$ is the intent of the input human utterance.']","  Based on the provided context information, I can answer your query about intent annotation as follows:

In the context of dialog systems and natural language processing, intent annotation refers to the process of labeling or tagging specific intents or goals within a conversation or text. This annotation helps the system understand the underlying purpose or objective of each utterance or sentence, which can then be used to generate appropriate responses or take relevant actions.

In the AntiScam and PersuasionForGood datasets, intent annotation is done using a hierarchical scheme, where on-task intents are defined for each dataset, and off-task intents are categorized into general and social intents. On-task intents are specific to the task at hand, while off-task intents are more general and can be applied across multiple tasks.

The intent annotation scheme includes nine on-task intents in the PersuasionForGood dataset, all related to donation actions, and six general intents and six additional social intents that are common across both tasks. The semantic slot annotation scheme is also used to annotate sentences based on their semantic content, with 13 main semantic slots identified in the anti-scam task.

Individuals unknowingly create a unique knowledge base with these images. The food images, in particular, are of interest as they contain a plethora of information. From the image metadata and using computer vision tools, we can extract distinct insights for each user to build a personal profile. Using the underlying connection between cuisines and their inherent tastes, we attempt to develop such a profile for an individual based solely on the images of his food. Our study provides insights about an individual's inclination towards particular cuisines. Interpreting these insights can lead to the development of a more precise recommendation system. Such a system would avoid the generic approach in favor of a personalized recommendation system.\tINTRODUCTION\tA picture is worth a thousand words. Complex ideas can easily be depicted via an image.

Pretrained models can be fine-tuned on natural language processing (NLP) tasks and have achieved significant improvements over training on task-specific annotated data. More recently, a pretraining technique named bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) BIBREF12 was proposed and has enabled the creation of state-of-the-art models for a wide variety of NLP tasks, including question answering (SQuAD v1.1) and natural language inference, among others.However, there have not been many efforts in exploring pretrained language representations for few-shot text classification.'
 'Improving Few-shot Text Classification via Pretrained Language Representations.\tText classification tends to be difficult when the data is deficient or when it is required to adapt to unseen classes.

Deep language representations have proven to be very effective forms of unsupervised pretraining, yielding contextualized features that capture linguistic properties and benefit downstream natural language understanding tasks. However, the effect of pretrained language representation for few-shot learning on text classification tasks is still not well understood. In this study, we design a few-shot learning model with pretrained language representations and report the empirical results. We show that our approach is not only simple but also produces state-of-the-art performance on a well-studied sentiment classification dataset.

While shallow methods like relation extraction are robust to data scarcity, they are less expressive than the deep meaning representation methods like semantic parsing, thereby failing at answering questions involving multiple constraints. Here we alleviate this problem by empowering a relation extraction method with additional evidence from Wikipedia. We first present a neural network based relation extractor to retrieve the candidate answers from Freebase, and then infer over Wikipedia to validate these answers. Experiments on the WebQuestions question answering dataset show that our method achieves an F_1 of 53.3%, a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art.\tIntroduction\tSince the advent of large structured knowledge bases (KBs) like Freebase BIBREF0 , YAGO BIBREF1 and DBpedia BIBREF2 , answering natural language questions using those structured KBs, also known as KB-based question answering (or KB-QA), is attracting increasing research efforts from both natural language processing and information retrieval communities.The state-of-the-art methods for this task can be roughly categorized into two streams.'

Inspired by the recent success of neural network models in KB question-answering BIBREF16 , BIBREF12 , and the success of syntactic dependencies for relation extraction BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , we propose a Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Network (MCCNN) which could exploit both syntactic and sentential information for relation extraction.In MCCNN, we use two channels, one for syntactic information and the other for sentential information.

Relation extraction methods typically answer with all the mountains in North America because of the lack of sophisticated representation for the mathematical function highest. To select the correct answer, one has to retrieve all the heights of the mountains, and sort them in descending order, and then pick the first entry. We propose a method based on textual evidence which can answer such questions without solving the mathematic functions implicitly.Knowledge bases like Freebase capture real world facts, and Web resources like Wikipedia provide a large repository of sentences that validate or support these facts. For example, a sentence in Wikipedia says, Denali (also known as Mount McKinley, its former official name) is the highest mountain peak in North America, with a summit elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190 m) above sea level. To answer our example question against a KB using a relation extractor, we can use this sentence as external evidence, filter out wrong answers and pick the correct one.Using textual evidence not only mitigates representational issues in relation extraction, but also alleviates the data scarcity problem to some extent.

94,What are the solutions proposed for the seq2seq shortcomings?,"['Towards better decoding and language model integration in sequence to sequence models\tThe recently proposed Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) framework advocates replacing complex data processing pipelines, such as an entire automatic speech recognition system, with a single neural network trained in an end-to-end fashion. In this contribution, we analyse an attention-based seq2seq speech recognition system that directly transcribes recordings into characters. We observe two shortcomings: overconfidence in its predictions and a tendency to produce incomplete transcriptions when language models are used. We propose practical solutions to both problems achieving competitive speaker independent word error rates on the Wall Street Journal dataset: without separate language models we reach 10.6% WER, while together with a trigram language model, we reach 6.7% WER.\tIntroduction\tDeep learning BIBREF0 has led to many breakthroughs including speech and image recognition BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 .'
 'A subfamily of deep models, the Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) neural networks have proved to be very successful on complex transduction tasks, such as machine translation BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , speech recognition BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , and lip-reading BIBREF13 . Seq2seq networks can typically be decomposed into modules that implement stages of a data processing pipeline: an encoding module that transforms its inputs into a hidden representation, a decoding (spelling) module which emits target sequences and an attention module that computes a soft alignment between the hidden representation and the targets. Training directly maximizes the probability of observing desired outputs conditioned on the inputs. This discriminative training mode is fundamentally different from the generative ""noisy channel"" formulation used to build classical state-of-the art speech recognition systems. As such, it has benefits and limitations that are different from classical ASR systems.Understanding and preventing limitations specific to seq2seq models is crucial for their successful development. Discriminative training allows seq2seq models to focus on the most informative features.'
 'Discriminative training allows seq2seq models to focus on the most informative features. However, it also increases the risk of overfitting to those few distinguishing characteristics. We have observed that seq2seq models often yield very sharp predictions, and only a few hypotheses need to be considered to find the most likely transcription of a given utterance. However, high confidence reduces the diversity of transcripts obtained using beam search.During typical training the models are conditioned on ground truth transcripts and are scored on one-step ahead predictions. By itself, this training criterion does not ensure that all relevant fragments of the input utterance are transcribed. Subsequently, mistakes that are introduced during decoding may cause the model to skip some words and jump to another place in the recording. The problem of incomplete transcripts is especially apparent when external language models are used.Model Description\tOur speech recognition system, builds on the recently proposed Listen, Attend and Spell network BIBREF12 . It is an attention-based seq2seq model that is able to directly transcribe an audio recording INLINEFORM0 into a space-delimited sequence of characters INLINEFORM1 .']","  Based on the given context information, the solutions proposed for the shortcomings of the attention-based seq2seq speech recognition system are as follows:

1. To address the overconfidence issue, the authors propose using a more diverse set of hypotheses during decoding, rather than relying solely on the most confident predictions. This can be achieved by increasing the beam size or using a more diverse set of initial states for the decoding process.
2. To address the incomplete transcripts issue, the authors propose incorporating external language models into the system. This helps to ensure that all relevant fragments of the input utterance are transcribed, and reduces the likelihood of mistakes during decoding.

These solutions have been shown to achieve competitive speaker-independent word error rates on the Wall Street Journal dataset, with a WER of 10.6% without separate language models, and a WER of 6.7% when using a trigram language model.",['Unacceptable'],1.0,0.9466021493425295,0.9999999999666667,0.0

112,What baseline did they use?,"['For the same reason, we are only providing the comparison of the label accuracy on the “SUPPORTS” label in the results section.System Description\tIn this section, we explain the design and all the underlying methods that our system has adopted. Our system is a pipeline consisting of three stages: (1) Question Generation, (2) Question Answering, (3) Label Classification. The question generation stage attempts to convert the claims into appropriate questions and answers. It generates questions similar to a Cloze-task or masked language modeling task where the named entities are masked with a blank. Question Answering stage predicts the masked blanks in an unsupervised manner. The respective predictions are then compared with the original answers and exported into a file for label classification. The label classifier calculates the predicted label based on a threshold.System Description ::: Question Generation\tThe claims generally feature information about one or more entities. These entities can be of many types such as PERSON, CITY, DATE. Since the entities can be considered as the content words for the claim, we utilize these entities to generate the questions.'
 'Results from Table TABREF17 suggests that our approach is comparable to HexaF for $\\phi $ = 0.76.Error Analysis ::: Question Generation\tThe typical errors that we observed for the question generation system are due to the known limitations of the NER tagger. Most of the claims that the system failed to generate the questions from contain entity types for which the tagger is not trained.For instance, the claim “A View to a Kill is an action movie.” has a movie title (i.e. A View to a Kill) and a movie genre (i.e. action) but Stanford CoreNLP NER tagger is not trained to identify such type of entities.Error Analysis ::: Question Answering\tWe describe the most recurrent failure cases of our answering model in the description below.Limitations of Vocabulary. Names like “Burnaby” or “Nikolaj” were not part of the original vocabulary while pre-training the BERT model, which makes it difficult to predict them using the same model.

114,How was the masking done?,"['Although the original masked language modeling task masks some of the tokens randomly, here we mask the named entities for generating the questions.System Description ::: Question Answering\tOriginally inspired by the Cloze-task and developed to learn to predict the masked entities as well as the next sentence, BERT creates a deep bidirectional transformer model for the predictions. Since the FEVER claims are masked to generate the questions, we use BERT to tokenize the claims. We observed that the BERT tokenizer sometimes fails to tokenize the named entities correctly (e.g. Named entity “Taran” was tokenized as “Tara”, “##n”). This is due to the insufficient vocabulary used while training the WordPiece tokenizer.To resolve this, we use Spacy Tokenizer whenever the WordPiece Tokenizer fails. Once the claim is tokenized, we use the PyTorch Implementation of the BERT model (BertForMaskedLM model) to predict the vocabulary index of the masked token. The predicted vocabulary index is then converted to the actual token.'
 ""This was one of the most recurring error types.Limitations of Tokenizer. The WordPiece tokenizer splits the token into multiple tokens. E.g. “Taran” into “Tara”, “##n”. In such cases, the answering system predicts the first token only which would be a substring of the correct answer. As we don't explicitly put a rule to avoid such cases, they are considered as incorrect answers.Conclusion\tIn this paper, we presented a transformer-based unsupervised question-answering pipeline to solve the fact checking task. The pipeline consisted of three stages: (1) Question Generation (similar to a Cloze-task), (2) Question Answering, (3) Label Classification. We use Stanford CoreNLP NER tagger to convert the claim into a Cloze-task by masking the named entities. The Question Generation task achieves almost 90% accuracy in transforming the FEVER dataset into a Cloze-task.

Later when the answers are generated, due to the question generation process, it becomes very easy to identify the correct answers.We use the BERT's (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) (BIBREF8) masked language model, that is pre-trained on Wikipedia articles for predicting the masked entities. Currently, neither the claim verification process nor the question generation process mandates explicit reasoning. For the same reason, it is difficult to put “REFUTES” or “NOT ENOUGH INFO” labels. To resolve this issue, we classify the unsupported claims as “MANUAL_REVIEW” instead of labeling them as “NOT ENOUGH INFO” or “REFUTES”.In the literature, the shared task has been tackled using pipeline-based supervised models (BIBREF9; BIBREF10; BIBREF11). To our knowledge, only BIBREF10 has provided the confusion matrix for each of the labels for their supervised system.""]","  Based on the given context information, I can answer the query as follows:

The masking in the FEVER task was done by using the Stanford CoreNLP NER tagger to convert the claim into a Cloze-task by masking the named entities.

As we know that kids in schools, first read and learn the syllabus content so that they can answer the questions in the exam. Similarly, our model learns a language model and linguistics features in unsupervised fashion from the provided Wikipedia pages.To transform the FEVER dataset into the above-mentioned task, we first generate the questions from the claims.

 ""Although function words such as conjunctions and prepositions form relationship between entities in the claims, we currently do not make use of such function words to avoid generating complex questions. The types of entities in a sentence can be recognized by using Stanford CoreNLP (BIBREF12) NER tagger.In our case, FEVER claims are derived from Wikipedia. We first collect all the claims from the FEVER dataset along with “id”, “label” and “verifiable” fields. We don't perform any normalization on the claims such as lowercasing, transforming the spaces to underscore or parenthesis to special characters as it may decrease the accuracy of the NER tagger. These claims are then processed by the NER tagger to identify the named entities and their type. The named entities are then used to generate the questions by masking the entities for the subsequent stage.This process not only transforms the dataset but also transforms the task into a Cloze-task or masked language modeling task.""

We asked three educated volunteers to annotate the results using a common protocol known as pointwise annotation nbciteacl,ijcai,seq2BF. In other words, annotators were asked to label either “0” (bad), “1” (borderline), or “2” (good) to a query-reply pair.

123,How does sentence construction component works?,"['Our system is developed to emulate the process of a person learning a new language and has to make guesses to understand new sentences from time to time. For example, someone, who understands the sentence “Bill plays a game” would not fully understand the sentence “Bill plays a popular board game” without knowing the meaning of “popular” and “board game” but could infer that the latter sentence indicates that its subject plays a type of game.The overall design of our system is given in Figure FIGREF7. Given a paragraph, our system produces a GF program (a pair of an abstract and a concrete syntax), which can be used for sentence generation. The system consists of two components, understanding sentences and generating GF grammar. The first component is divided into two sub-components, one for recognizing the sentence structure and one for recognizing the sentence components. The second component consists of a GF grammar encoder and a GF grammar exporter.'
 'It acts as the coordinator for all other succeeding rules.Given the seed components identified in Section SECREF15 and the above GF rules, a GF grammar for each sentence can be constructed. However, this grammar can only be used to generate fairly simple sentences. For example, for the sentence “Bill plays a popular board game with his close friends.”, a GF grammar for structure #2 can be constructed, which can only generate the sentence “Bill plays game.” because it does not contain any complement components identified in Section SECREF15. Therefore, we assgin a set of GF rules for the construction of each parameter in the GF rules in Table TABREF19. The set of GF rules has to follow two conventions. The first one is after applying the set of rules to some components of the sentence, the type of the production is one of the type in Table TABREF19, e.g. $NP$, $VP$, $Cl$, $V2$, .... The second convention is that the GF encoder will select the rules as the order from top to bottom in Table TABREF20.'
 'For example, the sentence “Bill plays a game” is encoded by a structure #2 and we expect that Bill, plays, and game correspond to the subject, verb, and object, respectively.We begin with recognizing the main words (components) that play the most important roles in the sentence based on a given sentence structure. This is achieved by program $\\Pi _2$ (Listing ). The first four rules of $\\Pi _2$ determine the main subject and verb of the sentence whose structure is #1, #2, #3, or #5. Structure #4 requires a special treatment since the components following tobe can be of different forms. For instance, in “Cathy is gorgeous,” the part after tobe is an adjective, but in “Cathy is a beautiful girl,” the part after tobe is a noun, though, with adjective beautiful. This is done using the four last rules of $\\Pi _2$.The result of program $\\Pi _2$ is an one-to-one mapping of some of the words in the sentence into the importaint components of a sentence, called main components, i.e.']","  Based on the provided context information, I can explain how the sentence construction component works.

The sentence construction component is a part of a system that emulates the process of a person learning a new language. It takes in a paragraph and produces a GF (Generalized Finite) program, which is a pair of an abstract syntax and a concrete syntax. This GF program can be used for sentence generation.

The sentence construction component consists of two parts: understanding sentences and generating GF grammar. The first part is divided into two sub-components: one for recognizing the sentence structure and one for recognizing the sentence components. The second part consists of a GF grammar encoder and a GF grammar exporter.

To construct a GF grammar for each sentence, the system uses a set of GF rules that are assigned to each parameter in the GF rules in Table TABREF19. These rules follow two conventions: the type of the production is one of the types in Table TABREF19, and the GF encoder will select the rules in the order from top to bottom in Table TABREF20.

As the sentence construction is done via GF, the paper includes a use case evaluation showing that the proposed system could also be utilized in addressing a challenge to create an abstract Wikipedia, which is recently discussed in the BlueSky session of the 2018 International Semantic Web Conference.\tIntroduction\tNatural language generation (NLG) has been one of the key topics of research in natural language processing, which was highlighted by the huge body of work on NLG surveyed in BIBREF0, BIBREF1. With the advances of several devices capable of understanding spoken language and conducting conversation with human (e.g., Google Home, Amazon Echo) and the shrinking gap created by the digital devices, it is not difficult to foresee that the market and application areas of NLG systems will continue to grow, especially in applications whose users are non-experts. In such application, a user often asks for certain information and waits for the answer and a NLG module would return the answer in spoken language instead of text such as in question-answering systems or recommendation systems. The NLG system in these two applications uses templates to generate the answers in natural language for the users.'
 'BIBREF20 (BIBREF20) describes a system that can give reasonable and supportive evidence to the answer to a question asked to an image, while BIBREF4 (BIBREF4) generates explanations for scheduling problem using argumentation. BIBREF21 (BIBREF21) use ASP to develop a system answering questions in the do-it-yourself domain. These papers use templates to generate answers. The generated GF program generated by our system, that is used for the NLG task, is automatically created from a provided input.The sophisticated system presented by BIBREF5 translates both question and the given natural language text to logical representation, and uses logical reasoning to produce the answer. Our system is similar to their system in that both employ recent developments of NLP into solving NLG problems.Conclusions and Future Work\tWe propose a system implemented using answer set programming (ASP) and Grammatical Framework (GF), for automatic generation of natural language descriptions in applications targeting mainstream users.'
 'Table TABREF27 shows the summary of the number of assessable sentences from our system. Out of 62 sentences from 3 portals, the system cannot determine the structure 2 sentences in Mathematics due to their complexity. This low number of failure shows that our 5 proposed sentence structures effectively act as a lower bound on sentence recognition module.In terms of quality, Table TABREF28 shows the average of BLEU and ROUGE score for each portal. Note that the average BLUE score is calculated only on BLEU assessable sentences, while average ROUGE score is calculated on the sentences whose structure can be recognized and encoded by our system. We note that the BLEU or ROUGE score might not be sufficiently high for a good quality translation. We believe that two reasons contribute to this low score. First, the present system uses fairly simple sentence structures. Second, it does not consider the use of relative clauses to enrich the sentences. This feature will be added to the next version of the system.Table TABREF32 summarizes the result of this use case.']","  Based on the provided context information, the two use cases that demonstrate the capability of the created system are:

It consists in training a model on out-of-domain data, and then continuing its training for a few epochs on the in-domain data only.Domain Adaptation ::: Corpus tags\tBIBREF12 propose a technique for multi-domain NMT, which consists in inserting a token in each source sequence specifying its domain.'

 'This is connected with the fact that the dialogue structure is more complex – information is spread in multiple utterances, discussions, questions, more typos and slang words appear there, posing new challenges for summarization. On the other hand, dialogues are divided into utterances, and for each utterance its author is assigned. We demonstrate in experiments that the models benefit from the introduction of separators, which mark utterances for each person. This suggests that dedicated models having some architectural changes, taking into account the assignation of a person to an utterance in a systematic manner, could improve the quality of dialogue summarization.We show that the most popular summarization metric ROUGE does not reflect the quality of a summary. Looking at the ROUGE scores, one concludes that the dialogue summarization models perform better than the ones for news summarization.

Since the SAMSum corpus contains dialogues created by linguists, the question arises whether such conversations are really similar to those typically written via messenger apps.

 'The accuracy was not that good and they did not bother to calculate it. Also, due to the integrated nature of conversational interaction in Persona, the necessary knowledge must be provided to each component of the system. Although it had limitations, it provided a very usable linguistic foundation for conversational interaction.The researchers thought that if they can create assistant models specific to the corresponding models, they can achieve better accuracy for those applications instead of creating a common unified personal assistant which at that time performed quite poorly. There was a surge in application-specific assistants like in-car intelligent personal assistant (Schillo et al, 1996 BIBREF5 ), spoken-language interface to execute military exercises (Stent et al, 1999 BIBREF6 ), etc. Since it was difficult to develop systems with high domain extensibility, the researchers came up with a distributed architecture for cooperative spoken dialogue agents (Lin et al, 1999 BIBREF7 ).Under this architecture, different spoken dialogue agents handling different domains can be developed independently and cooperate with one another to respond to the user’s requests.']","  Based on the provided context information, the limitations of the currently used quantitative metrics for evaluating conversational agents include:

 'Similarly, the metrics that are embedding-based consist of basic averages of vectors obtained through distributional semantics and so they are also insufficiently complex for modeling sentence-level compositionality in dialogue.The metrics that take into account the context can also be considered. Such metrics can come in the form of an evaluation model that is learned from data. This model can be either a discriminative model that attempts to distinguish between model and human responses or a model that uses data collected from the human survey in order to provide human-like scores to proposed responses.Conclusion\tIn this survey paper we explored the exciting and rapidly changing field of conversational agents. We talked about the early rule-based methods that depended on hand-engineered features. These methods laid the ground work for the current models. However these models were expensive to create and the features depended on the domain that the conversational agent was created for. It was hard to modify these models for a new domain. As computation power increased, and we developed neural networks that were able to capture long range dependencies (RNNs,GRUs,LSTMs) the field moved towards neural models for building these agents.'
 'In the last couple of years there has been a major effort to build on top of these baselines to make conversational agents more robust BIBREF15 BIBREF16 .Due to their large parameter space, the estimation of neural conversation models requires considerable amounts of dialogue data. Large online corpora are helpful for this. However several dialogue corpora, most notably those extracted from subtitles, do not include any explicit turn segmentation or speaker identification.The neural conversation model may therefore inadvertently learn responses that remain within the same dialogue turn instead of starting a new turn. Lison et al BIBREF17 overcome these limitations by introduce a weighting model into the neural architecture. The weighting model, which is itself estimated from dialogue data, associates each training example to a numerical weight that reflects its intrinsic quality for dialogue modelling. At training time, these sample weights are included into the empirical loss to be minimized. The purpose of this model is to associate each ⟨context, response⟩ example pair to a numerical weight that reflects the intrinsic “quality” of each example.

 'In the paper by Srinivas et al,2008 BIBREF11 , the authors proposed using data-driven techniques to build task structures for individual dialogs and use the dialog task structures for dialog act classification, task/subtask classification, task/subtask prediction and dialog act prediction.For each utterance, they calculated features like n-grams of the words and their POS tags, dialog act and task/subtask label. Then they put those features in the binary MaxEnt classifier. For this, their model was able to achieve an error rate of 25.1% for the dialog act classification which was better than the best performing models at that time. Although, according to the modern standards, the results are not that great but the approach they suggested (of using data to build machine learning models) forms the basis of the techniques that are currently used in this area.Sequence to Sequence approaches for dialogue modelling\tThe problem with rule-based models was that they were often domain dependent and could not be easily ported to a new domain. They also depended on hand crafted rules which was both expensive and required domain expertise. Two factors which when combined spell doom for scalbility.'
 'The state-action history for each agent was iterated over separately and the score from the recent dialog was averaged in with the expected return from the existing policy. They chose not to include any discounting factor to the dialog score as they progressed back through the dialog history. The decision to equally weight each state-action pair in the dialog history was made because an action’s contribution to the dialog score is not dependent upon its proximity to the end of the task. In order to combat the problem of converging to an effective policy they divided up the agent training process into multiple epochs.The average objective function score for the case of learned policies was 44.90. One of the main reasons for the low accuracy (which is also a limitation of this paper) was that there were a number of aspects of dialog that they had not modeled such as non-understandings, misunderstandings, and even parsing sentences into the action specification and generating sentences from the action specification.']","  Based on the provided context information, there is no direct mention of a benchmark for comparing different approaches in the field of task-oriented dialogue systems.

It is worth noting that there are several benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics available for task-oriented dialogue systems, such as the Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus (CMDC) and the Multi-Domain Dialogue Corpus (MDC). These datasets provide a variety of tasks and domains for evaluating the performance of task-oriented dialogue systems, and can be used to compare the effectiveness of different approaches.

153,What GAN and RL approaches are used?,"['The agent suffers from the cold start issue. In the case of end-to-end learning, they found that for a moderately sized knowledge base, the agent almost always fails if starting from random initialization.Actor-Critic Algorithm\tDeep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have significant potential for dialogue policy optimisation. However, they suffer from a poor performance in the early stages of learning as we saw in the paper in the above section. This is especially problematic for on-line learning with real users.In the paper by Su et al, 2017 BIBREF27 , they proposed a sample-efficient actor-critic reinforcement learning with supervised data for dialogue management. Just for a heads up, actor-critic algorithms are the algorithms that have an actor stores the policy according to which the action is taken by the agent and a critic that critiques the actions chosen by the actor (that is, the rewards obtained after the action are sent to the critic using which it calculates value functions).To speed up the learning process, they presented two sample-efficient neural networks algorithms: trust region actor-critic with experience replay (TRACER) and episodic natural actor-critic with experience replay (eNACER).'
 'Both models employ off-policy learning with experience replay to improve sample-efficiency. For TRACER, the trust region helps to control the learning step size and avoid catastrophic model changes. For eNACER, the natural gradient identifies the steepest ascent direction in policy space to speed up the convergence.To mitigate the cold start issue, a corpus of demonstration data was utilised to pre-train the models prior to on-line reinforcement learning. Combining these two approaches, they demonstrated a practical approach to learn deep RL-based dialogue policies and also demonstrated their effectiveness in a task-oriented information seeking domain.We can see in the figure FIGREF11 that the success rate reaches at around 95% for the case of policy trained with corpus data and using reinforcement learning which is impressive. Also, they train very quickly. For instance, for training just around 500-1000 dialogues, eNACER has a success rate of around 95% and TRACER has a success rate of around 92%. However, the authors noted that performance falls off rather rapidly in noise as the uncertainty estimates are not handled well by neural networks architectures.'
 'This can also be a topic for future research.Using Generative Adversarial Network\tRecently, generative adversarial networks are being explored and how they can be used in the dialog agents. Although generative adversarial networks are a topic in itself to explore. However, the paper mentioned below used uses reinforcement learning along with generative adversarial network so we cover it here inside the reinforcement learning methods.

The task is considered as a reinforcement learning problem where two systems get jointly trained: a generative model to produce response sequences, and a discriminator (similar to the human evaluator in the Turing test) that distinguishes between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones. The generative model defines the policy that generates a response given the dialog history and the discriminative model is a binary classifier that takes a sequence of dialog utterances as inputs and outputs whether the input is generated by the humans or machines.']","  Based on the provided context information, the following GAN and RL approaches are used:

Approaches like BIBREF17 are helpful but data to train these neural conversational agents remains scarce especially in academia, we talk more about the scarcity of data in a future section.Language Model based approaches for dialogue modelling\tThough sequence-to-sequence based models have achieved a lot of success, another push in the field has been to instead train a language model over the entire dialogue as one single sequence BIBREF18 . These works argue that a language model is better suited to dialogue modeling, as it learns how the conversation evolves as information progresses.Mei et al. BIBREF19 improve the coherence of such neural dialogue language models by developing a generative dynamic attention mechanism that allows each generated word to choose which related words it wants to align to in the increasing conversation history (including the previous words in the response being generated). They introduce a dynamic attention mechanism to a RNN language model in which the scope of attention increases as the recurrence operation progresses from the start through the end of the conversation.'

Their work is important in terms of the techniques they used.The speech recognition was done using n-gram statistical model which is then passed to a robust parser based on an extended Context Free Grammar allowing the system to skip unknown words and perform partial parsing. They wrote the grammar based on a combination of their own intuition and a small scale Wizard-of-Oz experiment they ran. The grammar rules used to identify bus stops were generated automatically from the schedule database. After this, they trained a statistical language model on the artificial corpus. In order to make the parsing grammar robust enough to parse fairly ungrammatical, yet understandable sentences, it was kept as general as possible. On making it public, they initially achieved a task success rate of 43.3% for the whole corpus and 43.6 when excluding sessions that did not contain any system-directed speech.After this they tried to increase the performance of the system (Raux et al, 2006 BIBREF10 ). They retrained their acoustic models by performing Baum-Welch optimization on the transcribed data (starting from their original models).'
 'Hence, their model generates more informative responses. However, they found the external knowledge plays a negative role in the procedure of response generation when there is more noise in the information. Exploring how to obtain credible knowledge of a given dialog history can be a future generation of their model.Reinforcement Learning based models\tAfter exploring the neural methods in a lot of detail, the researchers have also begun exploring, in the current decade, how to use the reinforcement learning methods in the dialogue and personal agents.Initial reinforcement methods\tOne of the first main papers that thought of using reinforcement learning for this came in 2005 by English et al BIBREF25 . They used an on-policy Monte Carlo method and the objective function they used was a linear combination of the solution quality (S) and the dialog length (L), taking the form: o(S,I) = INLINEFORM0 - INLINEFORM1 .At the end of each dialog the interaction was given a score based on the evaluation function and that score was used to update the dialog policy of both agents (that is, the conversants).'

In actuality, there are even more ways a model could learn to improve itself—for example, learning which question to ask in a given context to receive the most valuable feedback.'
 'We leave further exploration of this observation for future work.The same experiment repeated for HB Dialogue examples found that fresher HB examples were no more valuable than stale ones, matching our intuition that HB Dialogue examples are less targeted at current model failure modes than Feedback ones.Predicting User Satisfaction\tFor maximum efficiency, we aim to ask for feedback when it will most benefit our model. The approach we chose (classifying the tone of partner responses) takes advantage of the fact that it is easier to recognize that a mistake has already been made than it is to avoid making that mistake; or in other words, sentiment classification is generally an easier task than next utterance prediction.We compare this to the approach of asking for feedback whenever the model is most uncertain what to say next. This approach acts on the assumption that the model will be least confident when it is about to make a mistake, which we find very frequently to not be the case.'

The approach used in this study involved training a classifier on the Satisfaction task using only 1k training examples, which significantly outperformed both uncertainty-based methods and regular expression-based approaches.

To estimate user satisfaction, the model uses sentiment classification to identify when a mistake has been made and then asks for feedback. The approach of asking for feedback whenever the model is most uncertain what to say next was found to be less effective than asking for feedback based on identified mistakes. Additionally, the study found that fresher HB examples were not more valuable than stale ones in improving the model's performance.

The study used a combination of regular expressions and sentiment classification to identify user dissatisfaction and trigger feedback requests. The regular expressions used included identifying phrases such as ""said,"" ""asked,"" and ""told,"" as well as phrases that indicate a lack of sense or confusion. The sentiment classification was used to identify when the model had made a mistake and should ask for feedback.",['Unacceptable'],0.6666666666666667,0.9333612902675101,0.99999999995,0.0

Including these responses in the 60k HB dataset decreases hits@1/20 by 1.2 points and 0.6 points when added to 20k and 131k HH Dialogue examples, respectively. We also explored using chatbot responses with favorable satisfaction scores ( INLINEFORM0 ) as new training examples, but found that our models performed better without them (see Appendix SECREF10 for details).We also found that “fresher” feedback results in bigger gains. We compared two models trained on 20k HH Dialogue examples and 40k Feedback examples—the first collected all 40k Feedback examples at once, whereas the second was retrained with its first 20k Feedback examples before collecting the remaining 20k.'
 'The official hidden test set for the Dialogue task was used only to produce the final numbers included in this paper.Experimental Results\tThroughout this section, we use the ranking metric hits@X/Y, or the fraction of the time that the correct candidate response was ranked in the top X out of Y available candidates; accuracy is another name for hits@1/Y. Statistical significance for improvement over baselines is assessed with a two-sample one-tailed T-test.Benefiting from Deployment Examples\tOur main result, reported in Table TABREF16 , is that utilizing the deployment examples improves accuracy on the Dialogue task regardless of the number of available supervised (HH) Dialogue examples. The boost in quality is naturally most pronounced when the HH Dialogue training set is small (i.e., where the learning curve is steepest), yielding an increase of up to 9.4 accuracy points, a 31% improvement. However, even when the entire PersonaChat dataset of 131k examples is used—a much larger dataset than what is available for most dialogue tasks—adding deployment examples is still able to provide an additional 1.6 points of accuracy on what is otherwise a very flat region of the learning curve.'

The system appears to be a text-based AI assistant that processes natural language inputs and generates responses based on the given context. To ensure linearity in the size of the narrative input and the terminology, the system likely employs several techniques:

1. Tokenization: The system may break down the input text into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, phrases, or sentences. This allows the system to process the input in a more manageable and linear manner.
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER): The system may use NER to identify and extract specific entities such as names, locations, and organizations from the input text. This helps to reduce the complexity of the input and ensure that the system can focus on the relevant information.
3. Part-of-speech tagging: The system may use part-of-speech tagging to identify the grammatical categories of each word in the input text, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. This helps the system to understand the structure and",['The system scans the text word-by-word once and performs a voting task for each word.

Overall, we make the following contributions:Data\tTwitter is an online social networking platform. Users post 140-character messages, which appear in their followers' timelines. Because follower ties can be asymmetric, Twitter serves multiple purposes: celebrities share messages with millions of followers, while lower-degree users treat Twitter as a more intimate social network for mutual communication BIBREF13 . In this paper, we use a large-scale Twitter data set, acquired via an agreement between Microsoft and Twitter. This data set contains all public messages posted between June 2013 and June 2014 by several million users, augmented with social network and geolocation metadata.""
 'We also included the remaining users in our data set, but were not able to account for their geographical location.Researchers have previously shown that social network connections in online social media tend to be geographically assortative BIBREF29 , BIBREF30 . Our data set is consistent with this finding: for 94.8% of mutual-reply dyads in which both users were geolocated to one of the eight cities listed in sec:data-language, they were both geolocated to the same city. This assortativity motivates our decision to estimate separate influence parameters for local and non-local social connections (see sec:parametric-hawkes).Language Change as Social Influence\tOur main research goal is to test whether and how geographically distinctive linguistic markers spread through Twitter. With this goal in mind, our first question is whether the adoption of these markers can be viewed as a form of complex contagion. To answer this question, we computed the fraction of users who used one of the words listed in sec:data-language after being exposed to that word by one of their social network connections.'
 ""For example, lexical words are mainly transmitted through speech. We would expect their spread to be only weakly correlated with the Twitter social network. In contrast, abbreviations are fundamentally textual in nature, so we would expect their spread to correlate much more closely with the Twitter social network.Social network\tTo focus on communication between peers, we constructed a social network of mutual replies between Twitter users. Specifically, we created a graph in which there is a node for each user in the data set. We then placed an undirected edge between a pair of users if each replied to the other by beginning a message with their username. Our decision to use the reply network (rather than the follower network) was a pragmatic choice: the follower network is not widely available. However, the reply network is also well supported by previous research. For example, Huberman et al. argue that Twitter's mention network is more socially meaningful than its follower network: although users may follow thousands of accounts, they interact with a much more limited set of users BIBREF27 , bounded by a constant known as Dunbar's number BIBREF28 .""]","  Based on the information provided in the context, the paper does not explicitly discuss limitations of considering only data from Twitter. However, it is possible to infer some potential limitations of using only Twitter data.

Firstly, Twitter is a specific social media platform with its own unique features and user demographics, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other social media platforms or offline social networks. Additionally, the data set used in the study is limited to public messages posted by users between June 2013 and June 2014, which may not capture the full range of linguistic markers or social influences that exist on Twitter.

Furthermore, the study focuses solely on Twitter data and does not consider other forms of communication or social media platforms, which may be important for understanding the spread of linguistic markers and social influence more broadly. Finally, the study relies on geolocation metadata to identify local and non-local social connections, which may not be accurate or complete for all users.

Overall, while the paper provides valuable insights into the spread of linguistic markers on Twitter, it is important to consider these potential limitations when interpreting the findings and generalizing",['Unacceptable'],0.8,0.9392719780005745,0.9999999999,0.0
166,Did they represent tie strength only as number of social ties in a networks? ,"['This difference may explain why we do not observe complex contagion for lexical words.Social Evaluation of Language Variation\tIn the previous section, we showed that geographically distinctive linguistic markers spread through Twitter, with evidence of complex contagion for phonetic spellings and abbreviations. But, does each social network connection contribute equally? Our second question is therefore whether (1) strong ties and (2) geographically local ties exert greater linguistic influence than other ties. If so, users must socially evaluate the information they receive from these connections, and judge it to be meaningful to their linguistic self-presentation. In this section, we outline two hypotheses regarding their relationships to linguistic influence.Tie Strength\tSocial networks are often characterized in terms of strong and weak ties BIBREF37 , BIBREF3 , with strong ties representing more important social relationships. Strong ties are often densely embedded, meaning that the nodes in question share many mutual friends; in contrast, weak ties often bridge disconnected communities. Bakshy et al. investigated the role of weak ties in information diffusion, through resharing of URLs on Facebook BIBREF38 . They found that URLs shared across strong ties are more likely to be reshared.'
 'They found that URLs shared across strong ties are more likely to be reshared. However, they also found that weak ties play an important role, because users tend to have more weak ties than strong ties, and because weak ties are more likely to be a source of new information. In some respects, language change is similar to traditional information diffusion scenarios, such as resharing of URLs. But, in contrast, language connects with personal identity on a much deeper level than a typical URL. As a result, strong, deeply embedded ties may play a greater role in enforcing community norms.We quantify tie strength in terms of embeddedness. Specifically, we use the normalized mutual friends metric introduced by Adamic and Adar BIBREF39 : $$s_{i,j} = \\sum _{k \\in \\Gamma (i) \\cap \\Gamma (j)} \\frac{1}{\\log \\left(\n\\#| \\Gamma (k)|\\right)},$$   (Eq.'
 '28) where, in our setting, $\\Gamma (i)$ is the set of users connected to $i$ in the Twitter mutual-reply network and $\\#|\\Gamma (i)|$ is the size of this set. This metric rewards dyads for having many mutual friends, but counts mutual friends more if their degrees are low—a high-degree mutual friend is less informative than one with a lower-degree. Given this definition, we can form the following hypothesis:The linguistic influence exerted across ties with a high embeddedness value $s_{i,j}$ will be greater than the linguistic influence exerted across other ties.Geographic Locality\tAn open question in sociolinguistics is whether and how local covert prestige—i.e., the positive social evaluation of non-standard dialects—affects the adoption of new linguistic forms BIBREF6 . Speakers often explain their linguistic choices in terms of their relationship with their local identity BIBREF40 , but this may be a post-hoc rationalization made by people whose language is affected by factors beyond their control.']","  Based on the information provided in the context, the answer is no. The researchers did not represent tie strength only as the number of social ties in a network. Instead, they used a metric called ""normalized mutual friends"" to quantify tie strength, which takes into account both the number of mutual friends and the degree of those friends. This metric rewards dyads for having many mutual friends, but counts mutual friends more if their degrees are low.",['Unacceptable'],1.0,0.6994393846147657,0.49999999995,0.0

We therefore conclude that support for hypothesis H2—that the linguistic influence exerted across geographically local ties is greater than the linguistic influence across than across other ties—is limited at best.In sec:influence we found that phonetic spellings and abbreviations exhibit complex contagion, while lexical words do not.

On NYT, a similar trend is observed: the improvement in the models with the document labels over LDA is obvious but not in the models with the word features. Given the number of the document labels (194 of AN and 545 of NYT), it is possible that the document labels already offer enough information and the word embeddings have little contribution in the two datasets.To test the hypothesis that the incorporation of meta information in MetaLDA can significantly improve the modelling accuracy in the cases where the corpus is sparse, we varied the proportion of documents used in training from 20% to 80% and used the remaining for testing. It is natural that when the proportion is small, the number of unseen words in testing documents will be large.'
 'The original implementation was used. Following the paper, we set the number of pseudo documents to 1000 and INLINEFORM0 to 0.1.All the models, except where noted, the symmetric parameters of the document and the topic Dirichlet priors were set to 0.1 and 0.01 respectively, and 2000 MCMC iterations are used to train the models.Perplexity Evaluation\tPerplexity is a measure that is widely used BIBREF23 to evaluate the modelling accuracy of topic models. The lower the score, the higher the modelling accuracy. To compute perplexity, we randomly selected some documents in a dataset as the training set and the remaining as the test set. We first trained a topic model on the training set to get the word distributions of each topic INLINEFORM0 ( INLINEFORM1 ). Each test document INLINEFORM2 was split into two halves containing every first and every second words respectively. We then fixed the topics and trained the models on the first half to get the topic proportions ( INLINEFORM3 ) of test document INLINEFORM4 and compute perplexity for predicting the second half.'
 'In regard to MetaLDA, we fixed the matrices INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 output from the training procedure.

We ran all the models 5 times with different random number seeds and report the average scores and the standard deviations.In testing, we may encounter words that never occur in the training documents (a.k.a., unseen words or out-of-vocabulary words). There are two strategies for handling unseen words for calculating perplexity on test documents: ignoring them or keeping them in computing the perplexity.

170,Which other models that incorporate meta information do they compare against?,"['Although with improved performance there still exists challenges for existing models: (1) for aggregation-based models, it is usually hard to choose which meta information to use for aggregation; (2) the “single topic” assumption makes DMM models lose the flexibility to capture different topic ingredients of a document; and (3) the incorporation of meta information in the existing models is usually less efficient.To our knowledge, the attempts that jointly leverage document and word meta information are relatively rare. For example, meta information can be incorporated by first-order logic in Logit-LDA BIBREF21 and score functions in SC-LDA BIBREF22 . However, the first-order logic and score functions need to be defined for different kinds of meta information and the definition can be infeasible for incorporating both document and word meta information simultaneously.The MetaLDA Model\tGiven a corpus, LDA uses the same Dirichlet prior for all the per-document topic distributions and the same prior for all the per-topic word distributions BIBREF23 .'
 'In addition, compared with other models using meta information, our model runs significantly faster.\tIntroduction\tWith the rapid growth of the internet, huge amounts of text data are generated in social networks, online shopping and news websites, etc. These data create demand for powerful and efficient text analysis techniques. Probabilistic topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) BIBREF0 are popular approaches for this task, by discovering latent topics from text collections. Many conventional topic models discover topics purely based on the word-occurrences, ignoring the meta information (a.k.a., side information) associated with the content. In contrast, when we humans read text it is natural to leverage meta information to improve our comprehension, which includes categories, authors, timestamps, the semantic meanings of the words, etc. Therefore, topic models capable of using meta information should yield improved modelling accuracy and topic quality.In practice, various kinds of meta information are available at the document level and the word level in many corpora. At the document level, labels of documents can be used to guide topic learning so that more meaningful topics can be discovered.'
 'This is as expected because meta information serves as complementary information in MetaLDA and can have more significant impact when the data is sparser.It can be observed that models usually gained improved perplexity, if INLINEFORM0 is sampled/optimised, in line with BIBREF23 .On the AN dataset, there is no statistically significant difference between MetaLDA and DMR. On NYT, a similar trend is observed: the improvement in the models with the document labels over LDA is obvious but not in the models with the word features. Given the number of the document labels (194 of AN and 545 of NYT), it is possible that the document labels already offer enough information and the word embeddings have little contribution in the two datasets.To test the hypothesis that the incorporation of meta information in MetaLDA can significantly improve the modelling accuracy in the cases where the corpus is sparse, we varied the proportion of documents used in training from 20% to 80% and used the remaining for testing. It is natural that when the proportion is small, the number of unseen words in testing documents will be large.']","  Based on the given context information, the other models that incorporate meta information compared in the study are:

1. Logit-LDA BIBREF21
2. SC-LDA BIBREF22

These models also use meta information, but they have limitations in terms of flexibility and efficiency, as mentioned in the context information. The study aims to improve upon these existing models by incorporating both document and word meta information simultaneously, while also addressing the challenges of choosing which meta information to use for aggregation and capturing different topic ingredients of a document.",['Unacceptable'],0.6666666666666667,0.8128550870932724,0.9999999999666667,0.0
171,How do they measure topic quality?,"['Again, we report the average scores and the standard deviations over 5 random runs.It is known that conventional topic models directly applied to short texts suffer from low quality topics, caused by the insufficient word co-occurrence information. Here we study whether or not the meta information helps MetaLDA improve topic quality, compared with other topic models that can also handle short texts. Table TABREF65 shows the NPMI scores on the three short text datasets. Higher scores indicate better topic coherence. All the models were trained with 100 topics. Besides the NPMI scores averaged over all the 100 topics, we also show the scores averaged over top 20 topics with highest NPMI, where “rubbish” topics are eliminated, following BIBREF22 . It is clear that MetaLDA performed significantly better than all the other models in WS and AN dataset in terms of NPMI, which indicates that MetaLDA can discover more meaningful topics with the document and word meta information.'
 'The original implementation was used. Following the paper, we set the number of pseudo documents to 1000 and INLINEFORM0 to 0.1.All the models, except where noted, the symmetric parameters of the document and the topic Dirichlet priors were set to 0.1 and 0.01 respectively, and 2000 MCMC iterations are used to train the models.Perplexity Evaluation\tPerplexity is a measure that is widely used BIBREF23 to evaluate the modelling accuracy of topic models. The lower the score, the higher the modelling accuracy. To compute perplexity, we randomly selected some documents in a dataset as the training set and the remaining as the test set. We first trained a topic model on the training set to get the word distributions of each topic INLINEFORM0 ( INLINEFORM1 ). Each test document INLINEFORM2 was split into two halves containing every first and every second words respectively. We then fixed the topics and trained the models on the first half to get the topic proportions ( INLINEFORM3 ) of test document INLINEFORM4 and compute perplexity for predicting the second half.'
 'Note that: (1) The scores on AN with 150 and 200 topics are not reported due to overfitting observed in all the compared models. (2) Given the size of NYT, the scores of 200 and 500 topics are reported. (3) The number of latent topics in LLDA must equal to the number of document labels. (4) For PLLDA, we varied the number of topics per label from 5 to 50 (2 and 5 topics on NYT). The number of topics in PPLDA is the product of the numbers of labels and topics per label.The results show that MetaLDA outperformed all the competitors in terms of perplexity on nearly all the datasets, showing the benefit of using both document and word meta information. Specifically, we have the following remarks:By looking at the models using only the document-level meta information, we can see the significant improvement of these models over LDA, which indicates that document labels can play an important role in guiding topic modelling.']","  Based on the given context information, the authors of the paper measure topic quality using the Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) score. They report the NPMI scores averaged over all 100 topics and also the scores averaged over the top 20 topics with the highest NPMI, where ""rubbish"" topics are eliminated. The NPMI score is a measure of the coherence of each topic, with higher scores indicating better topic quality.",['Unacceptable'],1.0,0.9445297837761039,0.8333333332916666,0.0
172,Which data augmentation techniques do they use?,"['With both document and word meta information, MetaLDA still ran several times faster than DMR, LF-LDA, and WF-LDA. On NYT with the parallel settings, MetaLDA maintains its efficiency advantage as well.Conclusion\tIn this paper, we have presented a topic modelling framework named MetaLDA that can efficiently incorporate document and word meta information. This gains a significant improvement over others in terms of perplexity and topic quality. With two data augmentation techniques, MetaLDA enjoys full local conjugacy, allowing efficient Gibbs sampling, demonstrated by superiority in the per-iteration running time. Furthermore, without losing generality, MetaLDA can work with both regular texts and short texts. The improvement of MetaLDA over other models that also use meta information is more remarkable, particularly when the word-occurrence information is insufficient. As MetaLDA takes a particular approach for incorporating meta information on topic models, it is possible to apply the same approach to other Bayesian probabilistic models, where Dirichlet priors are used.'
 ""Moreover, at both the document and the word level, different labels/features may have different impact on the topics ( INLINEFORM6 / INLINEFORM7 ), which is automatically learnt in MetaLDA.Inference\tUnlike most existing methods, our way of incorporating the meta information facilitates the derivation of an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm. With two data augmentation techniques (i.e., the introduction of auxiliary variables), MetaLDA admits the local conjugacy and a close-form Gibbs sampling algorithm can be derived. Note that MetaLDA incorporates the meta information on the Dirichlet priors, so we can still use LDA's collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for the topic assignment INLINEFORM0 .""

We select from the previous 15 utterances, which is the longest context among all the experiments.

 'To test this hypothesis, we used two phone-labelled datasets distinct from all our ASR and AST datasets: the English TIMIT corpus (a language different to all of our trained models, with hand-labeled phones) and the Spanish GlobalPhone corpus (the same language as our AST source language, with phonetic forced-alignments produced using Kaldi). We randomly sampled utterances from these and passed them through the trained encoders, giving us a total of about 600k encoded frames. We used 400k of these to train logistic regression models to predict the phone labels, and tested on the remaining 200k frames.Separate logistic regression models were trained on the representations from each layer of the encoder. Since convolutional layers have a stride of 2, the number of frames decreases at each convolutional layer. To label the frames after a convolutional layer we eliminated every other label (and corresponding frame) from the original label sequence.'
 'For example, given label sequence S$_{\\text{1}}$ = aaaaaaann at input layer, we get sequence S$_{\\text{2}}$ = aaaan at the first convolutional layer and sequence S$_{\\text{3}}$ = aan at the second convolutional layer and at the following recurrent layers.Results for the two classification data sets (Figure FIGREF18) show very similar patterns. In both the ASR and the AST models, the pretraining data seems to make little difference to phonetic encoding at the early layers, and classification accuracy peaks at the second CNN layer. However, the RNN layers show a clear trend where phone classification accuracy drops off more slowly for models with better ASR/AST performance (i.e., zh $>$ fr $>$ pt). That is, the later RNN layers more transparently encode language-universal phonetic information.Phone classification accuracy in the RNN layers drops for both English and Spanish after fine-tuning on the AST data. This is slightly surprising for Spanish, since the fine-tuning data (unlike the pretraining data) is actually Spanish speech.']","  Based on the information provided in the context, the model has three layers: an input layer, two convolutional layers, and a recurrent layer.",['10 '],1.0,0.8832323442195085,0.9999999999,0.75

 ""Despite a more aggressive learning schedule, the performance of the augmented-data systems surpasses that of the baseline and pretrained models, even those trained on the largest ASR sets (150-hr Chinese and 300-hr English).For comparison to other work, Table TABREF16 (bottom) gives results for AST models trained on the full 160 hours of parallel data, including models with both pretraining and data augmentation. For the latter, we used the original learning schedule, but had to stop training early due to time constraints (after 15 days, compared to 8 days for complete training of the non-augmented 160h models). We find that both pretraining and augmentation still help, providing a combined gain of 3.8 (3.2) BLEU points over the baseline on the dev (test) set.Analyzing the models' representations\tFinally, we hope to gain some understanding into why pretraining on ASR helps with AST, and specifically how the neural network representations change during pretraining and fine-tuning.""

Statistics for each dataset are in the left half of Table TABREF7, with further details below.To look at a range of languages with similar amounts of data, we used GlobalPhone corpora from seven languages BIBREF15, each with around 20 hours of speech: Mandarin Chinese (zh), Croatian (hr), Czech (cs), French (fr), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), and Swedish (sv). French and Portuguese, like the source language (Spanish), belong to the Romance family of languages, while the other languages are less related—especially Chinese, which is not an Indo-European language.'
 'GlobalPhone consists of read speech recorded using similar conditions across languages, and the transcriptions for Chinese are Romanized, with annotated word boundaries.To explore the effects of using a large amount of pretraining data from an unrelated language, we used the AISHELL-1 corpus of Mandarin Chinese BIBREF16, which contains 150 hours of read speech. Transcriptions with annotated word boundaries are available in both Hanzi (Chinese characters) and Romanized versions, and we built models with each. To compare to the GlobalPhone data, we also created a 20-hour subset of the Romanized AISHELL (zh-ai-small) by randomly selecting utterances from a subset of the speakers (81, roughly the number present in most of the GlobalPhone datasets).Finally, to reproduce one of the experiments from BIBREF4, we pre-trained one model using 300 hours of Switchboard English BIBREF17. This data is the most similar to the AST speech data in terms of style and channel (both are conversational telephone speech).'
 'In related work on multilingual pretraining for low-resource ASR, Adams et al. BIBREF10 showed that pre-training on more languages helps, but it is not clear whether the improvement is due to including more languages, or just more data.To begin to tease apart these issues, we focus here on monolingual pretraining for low-resource AST, and investigate two questions. First, can we predict what sort of pretraining data is best for a particular AST task? Does it matter if the pretraining language is related to the AST source language (defined here as part of the same language family, since phonetic similarity is difficult to measure), or is the amount of pretraining data (or some other factor) more important? Second, can pretraining be effectively combined with other methods, such as data augmentation, in order to further improve AST results?To answer these questions, we use the same AST architecture and Spanish-English parallel data as Bansal et al. BIBREF4, but pretrain the encoder using a number of different ASR datasets: the 150-hour AISHELL corpus of Chinese as well as seven GlobalPhone languages, each with about 20 hours of data.']","  Based on the given context information, the following languages were used in the experiment:

 'Undesirable psychological effects of abuse on individuals make it an important societal problem of our time. Munro munro2011 studied the ill-effects of online abuse on children, concluding that children may develop depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems as a result of their encounters online. Pew Research Center, in its latest report on online harassment BIBREF0 , revealed that INLINEFORM0 of adults in the United States have experienced abusive behavior online, of which INLINEFORM1 have faced severe forms of harassment, e.g., that of sexual nature. The report goes on to say that harassment need not be experienced first-hand to have an impact: INLINEFORM2 of American Internet users admitted that they stopped using an online service after witnessing abusive and unruly behavior of their fellow users. These statistics stress the need for automated abuse detection and moderation systems.

These properties align well with the categorizations of abuse we discussed in the introduction.

187,How is abuse defined for the purposes of this research?,"['Different norms across (online) communities can affect what is considered abusive BIBREF1 . In the context of natural language, abuse is a term that encompasses many different types of fine-grained negative expressions. For example, Nobata et al. nobata use it to collectively refer to hate speech, derogatory language and profanity, while Mishra et al. mishra use it to discuss racism and sexism. The definitions for different types of abuse tend to be overlapping and ambiguous. However, regardless of the specific type, we define abuse as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group. Taking a course-grained view, Waseem et al. W17-3012 classify abuse into broad categories based on explicitness and directness. Explicit abuse comes in the form of expletives, derogatory words or threats, while implicit abuse has a more subtle appearance characterized by the presence of ambiguous terms and figures of speech such as metaphor or sarcasm. Directed abuse targets a particular individual as opposed to generalized abuse, which is aimed at a larger group such as a particular gender or ethnicity.'
 ""to better understand the content produced by them and make task-specific generalizations)? While we do not intend to provide answers to these questions within this survey, we hope that the above considerations can help to start a debate on these important issues.Labeling abuse. Labeling experiences as abusive provides powerful validation for victims of abuse and enables observers to grasp the scope of the problem. It also creates new descriptive norms (suggesting what types of behavior constitute abuse) and exposes existing norms and expectations around appropriate behavior. On the other hand, automated systems can invalidate abusive experiences, particularly for victims whose experiences do not lie within the realm of `typical' experiences BIBREF29 . This points to a critical issue: automated systems embody the morals and values of their creators and annotators BIBREF30 , BIBREF29 . It is therefore imperative that we design systems that overcome such issues. For e.g., some recent works have investigated ways to mitigate gender bias in models BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 .Abuse over time and across domains. New abusive words and phrases continue to enter the language BIBREF33 . This suggests that abuse is a constantly changing phenomenon.""
 ""In their study, Ross et al. ross stressed the difficulty in reliably annotating abuse, which stems from multiple factors, such as the lack of “standard” definitions for the myriad types of abuse, differences in annotators' cultural background and experiences, and ambiguity in the annotation guidelines. That said, Waseem et al. W17-3012 and Nobata et al. nobata observed that annotators with prior expertise provide good-quality annotations with high levels of agreement. We note that most datasets contain discrete labels only; abuse detection systems trained on them would be deprived of the notion of severity, which is vital in real-world settings. Also, most datasets cover few types of abuse only. Salminen et al. salminen2018anatomy suggest fine-grained annotation schemes for deeper understanding of abuse; they propose 29 categories that include both types of abuse and their targets (e.g., humiliation, religion).Feature engineering based approaches\tIn this section, we describe abuse detection methods that rely on hand-crafted rules and manual feature engineering.""]","  Based on the context information provided, abuse is defined in this research as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group.

For El Conde Lucanor, however, both approaches resulted in an increased of the effort need to generate an error-free modern version. This behavior was to be expected since the modernization quality for El Conde Lucanor was very low. Therefore, the system consistently generated wrong suffixes, resulting in the user having to make more corrections.Regarding the performance of both approaches, SMT achieved the highest effort reduction. This was reasonably expected since its modernization quality was better. However, in past neural IMT works BIBREF15, the neural IMT approach was able to yield further improvements despite having a lower translation quality than its SMT counterpart.'
 'An exception to this is El Conde Lucanor. The SMT approach yielded significant improvements in terms of TER, but was worse in terms of BLEU.

This behavior was already perceived by BIBREF2 and is, most likely, due to the small size of the training corpora—a well-known problem in NMT. However, while the goal of modernization is making historical documents as easier to comprehend by contemporary people as possible, our goal is different.

Continuous data like image or speech is much more tolerant to perturbations compared to text BIBREF6. In textual domain, even a small perturbation is clearly perceptible and can completely change the semantics of the text.

Adversarial examples help us identify the susceptibilities of the model and further counter those vulnerabilities by applying adversarial training techniques. In natural language domain, small perturbations in the form of misspellings or paraphrases can drastically change the semantics of the text. We propose a reinforcement learning based approach towards generating adversarial examples in black-box settings. We demonstrate that our method is able to fool well-trained models for (a) IMDB sentiment classification task and (b) AG's news corpus news categorization task with significantly high success rates. We find that the adversarial examples generated are semantics-preserving perturbations to the original text.\tIntroduction\tAdversarial examples are generally minimal perturbations applied to the input data in an effort to expose the regions of the input space where a trained model performs poorly.""
 ""In our work, we focus on constraining our adversary to craft examples with semantic preservation and minimum perturbations to the input text.Given different settings of the adversary, there are other works that have designed attacks in “gray-box” settings BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. However, the definitions of “gray-box” attacks are quite different in each of these approaches. In this paper, we focus on “black-box” setting where we assume that the adversary possesses a limited set of labeled data, which is different from the target's training data, and also has an oracle access to the system, i.e., one can query the target classifier with any input and get its corresponding predictions. We propose an effective technique to generate adversarial examples in a black-box setting. We develop an Adversarial Example Generator (AEG) model that uses a reinforcement learning framing to generate adversarial examples. We evaluate our models using a word-based BIBREF11 and character-based BIBREF12 text classification model on benchmark classification tasks: sentiment classification and news categorization.""
 'For training substitute network and generation of adversarial examples, we randomly draw data that is disjoint from the training data of the black-box model since we assume the adversaries have no prior knowledge about the training data or the model. Specifically, we consider attacking a target classifier by generating adversarial examples based on unseen input examples. This is done by dividing the dataset into training, validation and test using 60-30-10 ratio. The training data is used by the target model, while the unseen validation samples are used with necessary data augmentation for our AEG model. We further improve our model by using a self-critical approach to finally generate better adversarial examples. The rewards are formulated based on the following goals: (a) fool the target classifier, (b) minimize the number of perturbations and (c) preserve the semantics of the text.']","  Based on the provided context information, the proposed reinforcement learning based approach for generating adversarial examples in black-box settings uses an Adversarial Example Generator (AEG) model that utilizes a reinforcement learning framing to generate adversarial examples.

We did not use the responses with scores between -1 and 1 because they had a very weak Fact/Feeling assessment, which could be attributed to responses either containing aspects of both factual and feeling expression, or neither. The resulting set contains 3,466 fact and 2,382 feeling posts. We randomly partitioned the fact/feel responses into three subsets: a training set with 70% of the data (2,426 fact and 1,667 feeling posts), a development (tuning) set with 20% of the data (693 fact and 476 feeling posts), and a test set with 10% of the data (347 fact and 239 feeling posts).'
 'We define two thresholds: INLINEFORM0 to represent a minimum frequency value, and INLINEFORM1 to represent a minimum probability value. We found that using only a small set of patterns (when INLINEFORM2 is set to a high value) achieves extremely high precision, yet results in a very low recall. Instead, we adopt a strategy of setting a moderate probability threshold to identify reasonably reliable patterns, but labeling a text as factual or feeling only if it contains at least a certain number different patterns for that category, INLINEFORM3 . In order to calibrate the thresholds, we experimented with a range of threshold values on the development (tuning) data and identified INLINEFORM4 =3, INLINEFORM5 =.70, and INLINEFORM6 =3 for the factual class, and INLINEFORM7 =3, INLINEFORM8 =.55, and INLINEFORM9 =3 for the feeling class as having the highest classification precision (with non-trivial recall).The high-precision patterns are then used in the bootstrapping framework to identify more factual and feeling texts from the 11,561 unannotated posts, also from 4forums.com.'

Both of these prevent previous work from the full use of domains in existing datasets or building a new multi-domain dataset that not only can be used for multi-domain learning but also is easy to explore domain connection across datasets.In this paper, we focus on the extractive summarization and demonstrate that news publications can cause data distribution differences, which means that they can also be defined as domains. Based on this, we re-purpose a multi-domain summarization dataset MULTI-SUM and further explore the issue of domain shift.Methodologically, we employ four types of models with their characteristics under different settings. The first model is inspired by the joint training strategy, and the second one builds the connection between large-scale pre-trained models and multi-domain learning. The third model directly constructs a domain-aware model by introducing domain type information explicitly. Lastly, we additionally explore the effectiveness of meta-learning methods to get better generalization.'

Here, we begin with several simple approaches for multi-domain summarization based on multi-domain learning.Multi-domain Summarization ::: Four Learning Strategies\tTo facilitate the following description, we first set up mathematical notations. Assuming that there are $K$ related domains, we refer to $D_k$ as a dataset with $N_k$ samples for domain $k$. $D_k = \\lbrace (S_i^{(k)},Y_i^{(k)})\\rbrace _{i=1}^{N_k}$, where $S_i^{(k)}$ and $Y_i^{(k)}$ represent a sequence of sentences and the corresponding label sequence from a document of domain $k$, respectively.'

Notably, domains in this model are not explicitly informed of their differences.Therefore, the loss function of each domain can be written as:where Basic denotes our CNN-Transformer encoder framework (As described in Section SECREF15). $\\theta ^{(s)}$ means that all domains share the same parameters.Analysis: The above model benefits from the joint training strategy, which can allow a monolithic model to learn shared features from different domains. However, it is not sufficient to alleviate the domain shift problem, because two potential limitations remain: 1) The joint model is not aware of the differences across domains, which would lead to poor performance on in-task evaluation since some task-specific features shared by other tasks. 2) Negative transferring might happened on new domains.'
 'Lastly, we additionally explore the effectiveness of meta-learning methods to get better generalization. By analyzing their performance under in-domain, out-of-domain, and cross-dataset, we provide a preliminary guideline in Section SECREF31 for future research in multi-domain learning of summarization tasks.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:We analyze the limitation of the current domain definition in summarization tasks and extend it into article publications. We then re-purpose a dataset MULTI-SUM to provide a sufficient multi-domain testbed (in-domain and out-of-domain).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces domain shift to text summarization. We also demonstrate how domain shift affects the current system by designing a verification experiment.Instead of pursuing a unified model, we aim to analyze how different choices of model designs influence the generalization ability of dealing with the domain shift problem, shedding light on the practical challenges and provide a set of guidelines for future researchers.Domains in Text Summarization\tIn this section, we first describe similar concepts used as the domain in summarization tasks.']","  Based on the given context information, the four learning strategies investigated in the text are:

Importantly, the terse and difficult text style of tweets presents serious challenges to NER systems, which are usually trained using more formal text sources such as newswire articles or Wikipedia entries that follow particular morpho-syntactic rules. As a result, off-the-self tools trained on such data perform poorly BIBREF0 . The problem becomes more intense as the number of entities to be identified increases, moving from the traditional setting of very few entities (persons, organization, time, location) to problems with more.

While conversations are naturally multi-turn, pairwise setups typically consider single turn evaluations, taking the “gold” dialogue history from human-human logs, and only consider altering a single utterance. A more complete multi-turn evaluation is typically measured with a Likert scale (usually 1-4 or 1-5) after the conversation takes place. Some works such as BIBREF6 ask a series of questions relating to different aspects of conversational ability. There are some notable variants from these standard setups.'
 'ACUTE-EVAL: Improved Dialogue Evaluation with Optimized Questions and Multi-turn Comparisons\tWhile dialogue remains an important end-goal of natural language research, the difficulty of evaluation is an oft-quoted reason why it remains troublesome to make real progress towards its solution. Evaluation difficulties are actually two-fold: not only do automatic metrics not correlate well with human judgments, but also human judgments themselves are in fact difficult to measure. The two most used human judgment tests, single-turn pairwise evaluation and multi-turn Likert scores, both have serious flaws as we discuss in this work.  ::: We instead provide a novel procedure involving comparing two full dialogues, where a human judge is asked to pay attention to only one speaker within each, and make a pairwise judgment. The questions themselves are optimized to maximize the robustness of judgments across different annotators, resulting in better tests. We also show how these tests work in self-play model chat setups, resulting in faster, cheaper tests. We hope these tests become the de facto standard, and will release open-source code to that end.\tIntroduction\tDialogue between human and machine is an important end-goal of natural language research.'

One may also increase the number of quality-control annotations to decrease the likelihood of fraudulent workers, but we found using a single control question had a reasonable cost-noise ratio.Each specific pair of conversations is shown at most once, given that there are at least as many possible pairs of conversations as desired annotations. If there are more conversations available for each model than desired annotations, each conversation is shown at most once - that is, in only one annotation. We found that maximizing the diversity of pairs improved robustness of our evaluation across multiple replication experiments.Experiments\tWe perform experiments on two tasks, PersonaChat and Wizard of Wikipedia, which evaluate different aspects of conversational ability.'
 'In each trial, we show the annotator two whole conversations, with the second speaker in each conversation highlighted, as the judgment should be independent of the quality of the first speaker, see Figure FIGREF1. We then show a carefully worded question with two choices: speaker A or B, where the question measures a desired quality such as which speaker is more engaging, interesting or knowledgeable. Our experiments show that annotators perform well in this setup, and that our method can reveal subtle but significant differences between conversational models that other approaches, such as multi-turn Likert, cannot.Overall, our work provides the following contributions:A new evaluation method with a clear mechanism that provides fast, cheap iteration. This evaluation method allows efficient reuse of data from prior papers, allowing new models to be evaluated independently of baselines, and dramatically lowers the cost of annotation.We optimize question choices to find those with the highest agreement, increasing confidence in the desired test.'
 'The winning questions can then be used in future experiments by ourselves, and other researchers. Although having high inter-annotator agreement does not guarantee that crowdworkers interpret the question as intended, it increases the chance the question is understood uniformly. That is, the researcher still has to exercise care in the formulation of the question so that they believe it measures the quantity they are interested in. In our experiments we find questions with high-agreement rate over four axes: engagingness, interestingness, knowledge and humanness.Method: Acute-eval ::: Annotation Quality\tWe use crowdworkers for our annotations. We recommend limiting the number of annotations a single worker may complete to be only a few pairs (in our experiments, if we are making $N$ model comparisons then we allow $N$ annotations). In preliminary trials, we found that limiting the influence of any one worker was important for replicability, but that results were highly consistent across multiple runs with this limitation.Additionally, the first comparison any worker is asked to annotate consists of a conversation between a weak baseline model and human, and a human-human conversation.']","  Based on the provided context information, I can answer the query as follows:

Pairwise annotations are faster than other annotations because they only require evaluating two conversations at a time, whereas other annotation methods may require evaluating multiple conversations simultaneously. This is due to the fact that each conversation is shown at most once, given that there are at least as many possible pairs of conversations as desired annotations. Additionally, the use of a single control question for quality control annotations has been found to have a reasonable cost-noise ratio, making it a more efficient approach compared to other methods such as multi-turn Likert. Overall, pairwise annotations can be completed more quickly and efficiently than other annotation methods, allowing for faster iteration and lowering the cost of annotation.",['by 5 times'],0.75,0.9192885503948455,0.49999999995,0.0

 'When there is no target domain data available, fine-tuning hurts performance. But, with a moderate amount of target domain data, fine-tuning improves performance.Analysis\tTo better understand our model, in Figure 7 , we visualize the attention weights for the input sentence ""Can I wear jeans to a casual dinner?"" with different slots: (a) category, (b) item, and (c) time. From (a) and (b), it is clear that the attention is concentrated on the relevant words of the input and slot description. In contrast, there is no salient attention when the slot is not present in the input sentence.To analyze the impact of context, we compute the error rate with respect to span start position in the input sentence. Figure 4 shows that error rate tends to degrade for span start positions further from the beginning. This highlights opportunities to reduce a significant amount of errors by considering previous context.As shown in Figure 5 , our model makes more errors for longer spans. This can be improved by consulting spans detected by parsers or other span-based models such as coreference resolution systems BIBREF13 .Finally, we compute the percentage of POS tags that are tied to labeling errors.']","  Based on the given context information, the improvement margin for ZAT (Zero-shot Adaptation with Translation) over LSTM-BoE (Long Short-Term Memory with Bootstrapped Embeddings) is statistically significant, with a mean improvement of $4.04$ , $5.37$ and $3.27$ points over LSTM-BoE for training sizes 500, 1000, and 2000, respectively.

 'The complete formula is listed in Fig. FIGREF5 .Unfolded NMT networks approximate but do not exactly match the output of the ensemble due to two reasons. First, the unfolded network synchronizes the attentions of the individual models. Each decoding step in the unfolded network computes a single attention weight vector. In contrast, ensemble decoding would compute one attention weight vector for each of the INLINEFORM0 input models. A second difference is that the ensemble decoder first applies the softmax at the output layer, and then averages the prediction probabilities. The unfolded network averages the neuron activities (i.e. the logits) first, and then applies the softmax function. Interestingly, as shown in Sec. SECREF4 , these differences do not have any impact on the BLEU score but yield potential speed advantages of unfolding since the computationally expensive softmax layer is only applied once.Shrinking the Unfolded Network\tAfter constructing the weight matrices of the unfolded network we reduce the size of it by iteratively shrinking layer sizes.

Figure FIGREF1 depicts an example of our problem scenario. An IR component fetches several documents based on the query, and sample sentences are shown for each document. The goal is to extract the correct value, of which there may be many mentions in the text, for each slot. Sentences in INLINEFORM0 express a target slot, the number of fatalities, but the mention corresponds to an incorrect value. This is a common mistake in early news reports. Documents INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 also express this slot, and with mentions of the correct value, but with less certainty.A model which focuses on a single high-scoring mention, at the expense of breadth, will make an incorrect prediction.']","  Based on the provided context information, the following metrics are used to evaluate the models:

246,what are the baselines?,"['We define the information content of an article as the number of correct values which it mentions. Using this measure, we fit a skewed Gaussian distribution over the ordered news articles, assigning INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 is the smoothed information content of INLINEFORM2 as drawn from the Gaussian.A difficult machine reading problem unique to noisy text sources, where the correct values may not be present in the cluster, is determining whether to predict any value at all. A common solution for handling such missing values is the use of a threshold, below which the model returns null. However, even a separate threshold for each slot would not fully capture the nature of the problem.Determining whether a value is missing is a trade-off between two factors: (1) how strongly the mention-level scores support a non-null answer, and (2) how much general information regarding that event and that slot is given. We incorporate both factors by extending the definition of INLINEFORM0 and its use in Eq. EQREF9 –Eq. to include not only mentions, but all words.'
 ""The topic-based aggregation is statistically significant improvement over standard sum aggregation (p INLINEFORM0 ), and produces the highest performing unconstrained system.Date-based aggregation did not yield a statistically significant improvement over sum aggregation. We hypothesize that the method is sound, but accurate datelines could only be extracted for 31 INLINEFORM0 documents. We did not modify the aggregation weights ( INLINEFORM1 ) for the remaining documents, minimizing the effect of this approach.The EE-AS Reader has the lowest overall performance, which one can attribute to pooling evidence in a manner that is poorly suited to this problem domain. By placing a softmax over each document's beliefs, what is an advantage in the cloze-style QA setting here becomes a liability: the model is forced to predict a value for every slot, for every each document, even when few are truly mentioned.Effects of Global Constraints\tIn Table TABREF50 we show the results of incorporating factor graph constraints into our best-performing system.

 ""This is 14.9 points higher than Reschke's best system, and a statistically significant improvement over the unconstrained model (p INLINEFORM1 ). The improvements persist throughout training, as shown in Figure FIGREF52 .Additional iterations reduce performance. This effect is largely due to the constraint assumption not holding absolutely in the data. For instance, multiple slots can have the null value, and zero is common value for a number of slots. Running the constraint inference for a single iteration encourages a 1-to-1 mapping from values to slots, but it does not prohibit it. This result also implies that a hard heuristic decoding constraint time would not be as effective.Error Analysis\tWe randomly selected 15 development set instances which our best model predicts incorrectly. Of these, we find three were incorrectly labeled in the gold data as errors from the distance supervision hypothesis (i.e., “zero chance” being labeled for 0 survivors, when the number of survivors was not mentioned in the cluster), and should not be predicted. Six were clearly expressed and should be predictable, with highly correlated keywords present in the context window, but were assigned low scores by the model.""]","  Based on the given context information, I can provide the following answer to the query ""what are the baselines?""

The baselines refer to the minimum values that a model should achieve in order to be considered accurate. In the context of the task at hand, the baselines are the minimum number of correct values that an article should mention in order to be considered informative. The baselines are determined using a skewed Gaussian distribution, which assigns a smoothed information content to each article based on the number of correct values it mentions.

The baselines are important because they provide a benchmark for evaluating the performance of the model. A model that achieves a high number of correct values compared to the baseline is considered to be more accurate and informative. The baselines can also be used to determine the minimum number of correct values that an article needs to mention in order to be considered informative, which can be useful for applications where information content is critical.

255,Do they analyze which types of sentences/reviews are useful or not?,"[""In particular, reviews for users correspond to a diverse set of items that they have rated, resulting in notably heterogeneous textual contents with a variety of topics for different items. In contrast, each item's reviews are only about itself, and the contents are thus homogeneous in the sense that the topic is limited to a single narrow domain. For example, Fig. FIGREF1 shows several reviews from Amazon's health domain. User $u$'s historical reviews describe three items, Vitamin C, anti-inflammatory medication, and an air freshener, while all reviews for item $v$ are about itself, i.e., Vitamin D3.This profound difference necessitates distinct forms of attention to be paid on user reviews as opposed to item reviews, when deciding whether to recommend an item $v$ to a user $u$. To predict $u$'s preference of $v$, it is important to extract from $u$'s reviews those aspects that pertain most to $v$, e.g., comments on items that are similar to $v$. In contrast, from $v$'s reviews, we wish to account for the sentiment of other users with regard to relevant aspects of $v$.""
 ""To build an informative embedding for each review upon such sentences, we use a sentence-level attention network to aggregate the sentence embeddings $[{\\bf \\tilde{s}}_{1}^{v}, ..., {\\bf \\tilde{s}}_{k}^{v}]$ as follows, where the superscript $v$ is used to distinguish an item's notation from a user's notation.Here, $\\sum _{i=1}^{k}\\alpha _{i}^{v}=1$, and $\\alpha _{i}^{v}$ is the attention weight assigned to sentence ${\\bf \\tilde{s}}_{i}^{v}$. It quantifies the informativeness of sentence ${\\bf \\tilde{s}}_{i}^{v}$ with respect to $v$'s overall rating, compared to other sentences.""
 'That iswhere ${\\bf s}$ is the embedding of $s$ andwhere ${\\bf \\tilde{e}}_{0}$ is initialized by an all-zero vector ${\\bf 0}$.Suppose a review has $k$ sentences. We can then represent this review by a sequence $[{\\bf s}_{1}, ..., {\\bf s}_{k}]$, where ${\\bf s}_{i}$ is the embedding of the $i$-th sentence in the review, as inferred by Eq. (DISPLAY_FORM6). However, using Eq.

The authors do not provide any explicit information about which types of sentences or reviews are considered useful or not, but they do mention that the sentiment of other users with regard to relevant aspects of an item is important for predicting user preferences.

256,Which set of datasets do they use?,"['The $\\ell $ in Eq. (DISPLAY_FORM28) serves as our loss function for model training.Experiments\tIn this section, we evaluate our AHN model on several real datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art approaches.Experiments ::: Datasets\tWe conducted experiments on 10 different datasets, including 9 Amazon product review datasets for 9 different domains, and the large-scale Yelp challenge dataset on restaurant reviews. Table TABREF30 summarizes the domains and statistics for these datasets. Across all datasets, we follow the existing work BIBREF3, BIBREF17 to perform preprocessing to ensure they are in a $t$-core fashion, i.e., the datasets only include users and items that have at least $t$ reviews. In our experiments, we evaluate the two cases of $t=5$ and $t=10$. For the Yelp dataset, we follow BIBREF3 to focus on restaurants in the AZ metropolitan area. For each dataset, we randomly split the user–item pairs into $80\\%$ training set, $10\\%$ validation set, and $10\\%$ testing set.'
 'Typically, they associate users with the respective sets of reviews they have written, while associating each item with the set of all reviews that have been written for it. To predict the rating for an unseen user–item pair, in a first step, the embeddings of that user and item are inferred from the respective sets of reviews via a neural network. Then, the two embeddings are matched to predict a numeric rating between them. For example, DeepCoNN BIBREF1 relies on convolutional neural networks to learn user (item) embeddings, and on a factorization machine BIBREF5 to predict ratings. D-ATT BIBREF3 uses dual-attention based networks to learn embeddings, and a simple dot product to predict ratings.Despite the encouraging progress, existing methods all regard the set of reviews by a user and the set of reviews for an item as the same type of documents, and invoke the same model (or even a shared model) to process them in parallel. In reality, however, the set of reviews for a user is fundamentally different from the set of reviews for an item.'
 ""FIGREF33, we observe that AHN generally gains more on the 10-core datasets, with absolute gains of up to $11.6\\%$ (DeepCoNN), $7.0\\%$ (D-ATT), $13.8\\%$ (MPCN), and $8.4\\%$ (HUITA). This suggests that the more reviews each user and item has, the more important it is to perform proper attention learning on relevant reviews and sentences on both the user and item sides.Experiments ::: Case Study\tWe next investigate the interpretability of AHN. Fig. FIGREF43(a) and (b) show the attention weights of AHN on the top three reviews of a pair of user and item on the Health dataset, where the item is a sleep aid medicine. In each of the user's reviews, the highlighted words indicate the item described by the review. As can be seen, the first two items “krill oil” and “pain relief patch” are more relevant to the item “sleep aid medicine” than the “laundry detergent” in the lowest-weighted review.""]","  Based on the provided context information, the set of datasets used in the experiments is:

The original dataset also contained a relatively small number of “racist” label tweets, but we only retain “sexist” samples to focus on gender biases. BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , the creators of the dataset, describe “sexist” and “racist” languages as specific subsets of abusive language.Abusive Tweets (abt)\tRecently, BIBREF4 has published a large scale crowdsourced abusive tweet dataset with 60K tweets. Their work incrementally and iteratively investigated methods such as boosted sampling and exploratory rounds, to effectively annotate tweets through crowdsourcing.'
 'This kind of evaluation has also been performed in SemEval 2018: Task 1 Affect In Tweets BIBREF12 to measure the gender and race bias among the competing systems for sentiment/emotion analysis.Using the released code of BIBREF1 , we generated 1,152 samples (576 pairs) by filling the templates with common gender identity pairs (ex. male/female, man/woman, etc.). We created templates (Table TABREF6 ) that contained both neutral and offensive nouns and adjectives inside the vocabulary (See Table TABREF7 ) to retain balance in neutral and abusive samples.For the evaluation metric, we use 1) AUC scores on the original test set (Orig. AUC), 2) AUC scores on the unbiased generated test set (Gen. AUC), and 3) the false positive/negative equality differences proposed in BIBREF1 which aggregates the difference between the overall false positive/negative rate and gender-specific false positive/negative rate. False Positive Equality Difference (FPED) and False Negative Equality Difference (FNED) are defined as below, where INLINEFORM0 .'
 'For gender swapping data augmentation, we use pairs identified through crowd-sourcing by BIBREF13 .After identifying the degree of gender bias of each dataset, we select a source with less bias and a target with more bias. Vocabulary is extracted from training split of both sets. The model is first trained by the source dataset. We then remove final softmax layer and attach a new one initialized for training the target. The target is trained with a slower learning rate. Early stopping is decided by the valid set of the respective dataset.Based on this criterion and results from Section SECREF13 , we choose the abt dataset as source and st dataset as target for bias fine-tuning experiments.Results & Discussions\tTables TABREF12 and TABREF14 show the bias measurement experiment results for st and abt, respectively. As expected, pre-trained embeddings improved task performance. The score on the unbiased generated test set (Gen. ROC) also improved since word embeddings can provide prior knowledge of words.However, the equality difference scores tended to be larger when pre-trained embeddings were used, especially in the st dataset.']","  Based on the provided context information, the following metrics are used to measure gender biases:

1. AUC scores on the original test set (Orig. AUC)

 'Due to their terse nature, such noisy data often lack enough context, which poses a challenge to the correct identification of named entities. To address this issue we have presented and evaluated a novel approach using the Ritter dataset, showing consistent results over state-of-the-art models without using any external resource or encoded rule, achieving an average of 0.59 F1. The results slightly outperformed state-of-the-art models which do not rely on encoded rules (0.49 and 0.54 F1), suggesting the viability of using the produced metadata to also boost existing NER approaches. A further important contribution is the ability to handle single tokens and misspelled words successfully, which is of utmost importance in order to better understand short texts. Finally, the architecture of the approach and its indicators introduce potential to transparently support multilingual data, which is the subject of ongoing investigation.Acknowledgments\tThis research was supported in part by an EU H2020 grant provided for the HOBBIT project (GA no. 688227) and CAPES Foundation (BEX 10179135).'

 'The major advantages of this approach are: 1) the fact that there are no hand-crafted rules encoded; 2) the ability to handle misspelled words (because the search engine alleviates that and returns relevant or related information) and incomplete sentences; 3) the generic design of its components, allowing multilingual processing with little effort (the only dependency is the POS tagger) and straightforward extension to support more NER classes (requiring a corpus of images and text associated to each desired NER class, which can be obtained from a Knowledge Base, such as DBpedia, and an image dataset, such as METU dataset). While initial results in a gold standard dataset showed the potential of the approach, we also plan to integrate these outcomes into a Sequence Labeling (SL) system, including neural architectures such as LSTM, which are more suitable for such tasks as NER or POS.

The main drawback is the performance of those models with noisy data, such as Tweets. A major reason is that they rely heavily on hand-crafted features and domain-specific knowledge.
