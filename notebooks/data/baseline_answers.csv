How do they decide what is the semantic concept label of particular cluster?,1909.00091,extractive,"Given a cluster, our algorithm proceeds with the following three steps:

Sense disambiguation: The goal is to assign each cluster word to one of its WordNet synsets; let $S$ represent the collection of chosen synsets. We know that these words have been clustered in domain-specific embedding space, which means that in the context of the domain, these words are very close semantically. Thus, we choose $S^*$ that minimizes the total distance between its synsets.

Candidate label generation: In this step, we generate $L$, the set of possible cluster labels. Our approach is simple: we take the union of all hypernyms of the synsets in $S^*$.

Candidate label ranking: Here, we rank the synsets in $L$. We want labels that are as close to all of the synsets in $S^*$ as possible; thus, we score the candidate labels by the sum of their distances to each synset in $S^*$ and we rank them from least to most distance.

In steps 1 and 3, we use WordNet pathwise distance, but we encourage the exploration of other distance representations as well.","  Based on the provided context information, the authors use a combination of domain-specific word embeddings and WordNet to automatically label the clusters. Specifically, they use the following steps to determine the semantic concept label of each cluster:

1. Sense disambiguation: They assign each cluster word to one of its WordNet synsets, which are the possible meanings of the word. They choose the set of synsets that minimizes the total distance between them.
2. Candidate label generation: They generate a set of possible cluster labels by taking the union of all hypernyms of the synsets in the chosen set.
3. Candidate label ranking: They rank the candidate labels based on the sum of their distances to each synset in the chosen set. The label with the least distance to all synsets is selected as the final label for the cluster.

How do data-driven models usually respond to abuse?,1909.04387,abstractive,"either by refusing politely, or, with flirtatious responses, or, by retaliating","  Based on the provided context information, I can provide an answer to the query ""How do data-driven models usually respond to abuse?""

According to the paper you mentioned, data-driven models are systems that use machine learning algorithms to generate responses to user input. These models were tested in a large-scale crowd-sourced evaluation of abuse response strategies. The results showed that some strategies, such as ""polite refusal,"" scored highly across the board, while for other strategies, demographic factors and the severity of the preceding abuse influenced the user's perception of which response was appropriate. Additionally, most data-driven models lagged behind rule-based or commercial systems in terms of their perceived appropriateness.

Therefore, it can be concluded that data-driven models usually respond to abuse by using pre-defined templates or generic responses, which may not always be appropriate or effective in addressing the situation. The paper highlights the need for more effective control mechanisms to improve the perceived appropriateness of data-driven response generation."
