 'Other types of consequences of a condition in a sentence may help practitioner to find what is true about a patient. In this paper, we propose an automated process to find and extract condition-action statements from medical guidelines. We employed NLP tools and concepts in the process to achieve more general models.We define the task as classification task. Given an input statement, classify it to one of the three categories: NC (no condition) if the statement doesn’t have a condition; CA if the statement is a condition-action sentence; and CC (condition-consequence) if the statement has a condition which has a non-action consequence. For a CDSS, to determine both ""what is true"" about a patient and ""what to do"" with a patient, CC and CA statements can be merged to one category.There are limitations in this specification of classification categories. For example, guidelines may contain statements with a condition referring to a consequence in another statement. Or, we can see condition and effect in two different sentences: ""However, there are some cases for which the results for black persons were different from the results for the general population (question 3, evidence statements 2, 10, and 17).'

On the other hand, for example, we cannot paraphrase ""Further, the diagnostic criteria for CKD do not consider age-related decline in kidney function as reflected in estimated GFR"" to an if-then sentence.We also annotated the type of sentences based on their semantics: We classified them into three classes: condition-action, condition-consequence(effect, intention, and event) and action.

These findings raise the question whether it would be possible to realize similar advantages for other languages that currently lack dedicated models of this type. It is likely that the feasibility of training high quality deep transfer learning models hinges on the availability of pretraining data.As of this writing, Finnish ranks 24th among the different language editions of Wikipedia by article count, and 25th in Common Crawl by page count.

7,What does the cache consist of?,"['The lifetime of a private cache actually can last for the entire dialog section for a specific user. The private cache keeps updating during the dialog session, making processing the subsequent utterances faster as more states are composed and stored in $T_D$. With this accumulated dynamic cache, a longer dialog can expect a better RTF in theory. In general, the static public cache serves all threads, while the private cache boosts the performance within a dialog session. The private cache will be freed at the end of the dialog.Architecture and Algorithm ::: Pre-composition algorithm for class language models\tBased on the algorithm described in BIBREF3, we allow the states $(q_1, q_2)$ such that $q_2 = (q_c, q_p), q_c \\in Q_c, q_p=0 $ to be pre-composed, where $q_c$ and $q_p$ denote states in $G_c$ and $G_p$, respectively.'
 '$T_D$ may need to copy some states from $T_P$ if we need to update information for those states in $T_P$.In order to support this mechanism, we use a two-layered cached FST for decoding. The first layer is public cache which represents $T_P$. It is a static cache created by pre-initialization. The second layer is the private cache, which is owned by a particular user and constructed on-the-fly. Figure FIGREF9 shows the architecture of our two-layer FST. The solid box denotes the static graph and the dashed ones show the dynamic graph. Personalized states will appear only in $T_D$.The static public cache stores the most frequent states, which greatly reduces the run time factor (RTF) of online decoding. Since $T_D$ has a smaller size than a fully dynamic graph, the marginal memory efficiency for multi-threaded service will be better.Furthermore, the private cache will not be freed after decoding a single utterance. The lifetime of a private cache actually can last for the entire dialog section for a specific user.'
 'This one-time cost calculation can do some composition in advance. During decoding search, the FST will skip the composition of pre-initialized states. However, extending this algorithm to class LMs is non-trivial in practice. For a class LM, the non-terminal states cannot be composed during pre-initialization since we need a pre-initialization that is applicable to all users, which means we need to apply some restrictions to prevent composition of the personalized part.We define $T_P$ as a partial composed FST structure for $T=T_1 \\circ T_2$, where $P \\subseteq Q$ is the set of pre-composed states. In real time decoding, the on-the-fly composition will be performed on top of the pre-initialized $T_P$, which is similar to previous work BIBREF3. In a production environment, multiple threads will share the same pre-composed FST $T_P$ structure, while each thread will own a private FST structure.where $T_D$ is the dynamic cache built on top of $T_P$.']","  Based on the provided context information, the cache consists of two layers:

A conventional WFST decoder searches a statically composed $H C L G$ graph, where $H$ is the graph that translates HMM states to CD phones, $C$ translates CD phones to graphemes, $L$ translates graphemes to words and $G$ is graph that represents the language model.

Experiments with a calling speech recognition task using a personalized contact list demonstrate that the proposed public cache reduces decoding time by factor of three compared to decoding without pre-initialization. Using the private cache provides additional efficiency gains, reducing the decoding time by a factor of five.\tIntroduction\tSpeech input is now a common feature for smart devices.

A conventional WFST decoder searches a statically composed $H C L G$ graph, where $H$ is the graph that translates HMM states to CD phones, $C$ translates CD phones to graphemes, $L$ translates graphemes to words and $G$ is graph that represents the language model. Using a statically composed graph has two limitations. First, it is both compute and memory intensive when the vocabulary and LM are large. Second, the static graph approach makes it hard to handle personalized language models BIBREF2.']","  Based on the given context information, a personalized language model refers to a language model that is tailored to a specific user's preferences, interests, and usage patterns. It is designed to improve the recognition of entities that are unique to the user, such as names from their contact list, locations, or music titles. A personalized language model is created by training a machine learning model on the user's past interactions and preferences, allowing it to better understand their specific language usage and preferences. This can improve the accuracy of speech recognition for tasks such as making phone calls, messaging, or playing favorite music.",['A model that contains the expected user-specific entities.'],0.6666666666666667,0.9716240520023888,0.5833333333041666,1.0

To predict polarity, we assume the majority class of negative sentiment. We base this assumption on the fact that the domain we are working with doesn't seem to support the presence of positive sentiment, as made evident by the highly imbalanced dataset.Owing to the nature of the problem domain, there is considerable variance in the source of the text documents and their structure.""

The morphological tag generalizes traditional part-of-speech tags, enriching them with further linguistic knowledge such as tense, mood, and grammatical case. We call the individual key–attribute pairs morphological attributes.An example of a sentence annotated with morphological tags and lemmata in context is given in fig:sentence. The task of mapping a sentence to a sequence of morphological tags is known as morphological tagging.A Joint Neural Model\tThe primary contribution of this paper is a joint model of morphological tagging and lemmatization. The intuition behind the joint model is simple: high-accuracy lemmatization requires a representation of the sentential context, in which the word occurs (this behind has been evinced in sec:introduction)—a morphological tag provides the precise summary of the context required to choose the correct lemma. Armed with this, we define our joint model of lemmatization and morphological tagging as: DISPLAYFORM0  fig:model illustrates the structure of our model in the form of a graphical model.'
 'We factor the probabilistic lemmatizer as, DISPLAYFORM0 The summation is computed with dynamic programming—specifically, using the forward algorithm for hidden Markov models BIBREF23 .

To enforce monotonicity, INLINEFORM4 if INLINEFORM5 .Decoding\tWe consider two manners, by which we decode our model. The first is a greedy decoding scheme. The second is a crunching BIBREF24 scheme.

This sort of scheme is also referred to as pipeline decoding.In the crunching scheme, we first extract a INLINEFORM0 -best list of taggings from the morphological tagger.']","  Based on the provided context information, the authors also consider the following previous work in their study:

19,what languages did they experiment with?,"['In 8 out of 20 languages, the improvement is statistical significant with INLINEFORM0 . We select the best INLINEFORM1 for each language based on the development set.In fig:error-analysis, we provide a language-wise breakdown of the performance of our model and the model of N18-1126. Our strongest improvements are seen in Latvian, Greek and Hungarian. When measuring performance solely over unseen inflected forms, we achieve even stronger gains over the baseline method in most languages. This demonstrates the generalization power of our model beyond word forms seen in the training set. In addition, our accuracies on ambiguous tokens are also seen to be higher than the baseline on average, with strong improvements on highly inflected languages such as Latvian and Russian. Finally, on seen unambiguous tokens, we note improvements that are similar across all languages.Error Patterns\tWe attempt to identify systematic error patterns of our model in an effort to motivate future work. For this analysis, we compare predictions of our model and the gold lemmata on three languages with the weakest absolute performance: Estonian, Latvian and Arabic.'
 'Empirically, we have shown that our model achieves state-of-the-art results, hinting that explicitly modeling morphological tags is a more effective manner for modeling context. In addition to strong numbers, we tried to explain when and why our model does better. Specifically, we show a significant correlation between our scores and the number of tokens and tags present in a treebank. We take this to indicate that our method improves performance more for low-resource languages as well as morphologically rich languages.Acknowledgments\tWe thank Toms Bergmanis for his detailed feedback on the accepted version of the manuscript.

 ""The suffix -ma in Estonian is used to indicate the infinitive form of verbs. Gold lemmata for verbs in Estonian are marked in their infinitive forms whereas our system predicts the stems of these verbs instead. These inflected forms are usually ambiguous and we believe that the model doesn't generalize well to different form-lemma pairs, partly due to fewer training data available for Estonian. This is an example of an error pattern that could be corrected using improved morphological information about the tokens. Finally, in Arabic, we find that the most common error pattern corresponds to a single ambiguous word form, 'an , which can be lemmatized as 'anna (like “that” in English) or 'an (like “to” in English) depending on the usage of the word in context. The word 'anna must be followed by a nominal sentence while 'an is followed by a verb. Hence, models that can incorporate rich contextual information would be able to avoid such errors.Why our model performs better?\tSimply presenting improved results does not entirely satiate our curiosity: we would also like to understand why our model performs better.""]","  Based on the given context information, the researchers experimented with 20 languages in their study.","['They experiment with: arabic' ' basque' ' croatian' ' dutch' ' estonian'

28,Do they demonstrate the relationship between veracity and stance over time in the Twitter dataset?,"['We observe that the temporal dynamics of public stances can indicate rumor veracity. Figure FIGREF2 illustrates the stance distributions of tweets discussing $true$ rumors, $false$ rumors, and $unverified$ rumors, respectively. As we can see, $supporting$ stance dominates the inception phase of spreading. However, as time goes by, the proportion of $denying$ tweets towards $false$ rumors increases quite significantly. Meanwhile, the proportion of $querying$ tweets towards $unverified$ rumors also shows an upward trend. Based on this observation, we propose to model the temporal dynamics of stance evolution with a recurrent neural network (RNN), capturing the crucial signals containing in stance features for effective veracity prediction.Further, most existing methods tackle stance classification and veracity prediction separately, which is suboptimal and limits the generalization of models. As shown previously, they are two closely related tasks in which stance classification can provide indicative clues to facilitate veracity prediction.'
 'Therefore, when the supervision signal of stance classification becomes strong, the learned stance features can produce more accurate clues for predicting rumor veracity.Experiments ::: Case Study\tFigure FIGREF33 illustrates a $false$ rumor identified by our model. We can observe that the stances of reply tweets present a typical temporal pattern “$supporting\\rightarrow querying\\rightarrow denying$”. Our model captures such stance evolution with RNN and predicts its veracity correctly. Further, the visualization of tweets shows that the max-pooling operation catches informative tweets in the conversation. Hence, our framework can notice salience indicators of rumor veracity in the spreading process and combine them to give correct prediction.Conclusion\tWe propose a hierarchical multi-task learning framework for jointly predicting rumor stance and veracity on Twitter. We design a new graph convolution operation, Conversational-GCN, to encode conversation structures for classifying stance, and then the top Stance-Aware RNN combines the learned features to model the temporal dynamics of stance evolution for veracity prediction. Experimental results verify that Conversational-GCN can handle deep conversation structures effectively, and our hierarchical framework performs much better than existing methods.'
 ""Intuitively, a tweet's nearer neighbors in its conversation thread are more informative than farther neighbors because the replying relationships of them are closer, and their stance expressions can help classify the stance of the center tweet (e.g., in Figure FIGREF1, tweets “1”, “4” and “5” are the one-hop neighbors of the tweet “2”, and their influences on predicting the stance of “2” are larger than that of the two-hop neighbor “3”). To achieve this, we represent both tweet contents and conversation structures into a latent space using a graph convolutional network (GCN) BIBREF15, aiming to learn stance feature for each tweet by aggregating its neighbors' features. Compared with the sequential and temporal based methods, our aggregation based method leverages the intrinsic structural property in conversations to learn tweet representations.After determining the stances of people's reactions, another challenge is how we can utilize public stances to predict rumor veracity accurately. We observe that the temporal dynamics of public stances can indicate rumor veracity.""]","  Based on the given context information, it appears that the authors of the paper are suggesting a relationship between veracity and stance over time in the Twitter dataset. Specifically, they observe that as time goes by, the proportion of denying tweets towards false rumors increases significantly, while the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend. This suggests that there may be a correlation between the stance of tweets and their veracity over time. However, without further information or analysis, it is not possible to definitively state whether such a relationship exists in the Twitter dataset.",['Unacceptable'],1.0,0.9742444136495383,0.9999999999666667,0.0

We use a random sample of 5000 sentences from the test set of WikiText-103 BIBREF20 and a random sample of 5000 sentences from TBC as references.We also evaluate the perplexity of a trained language model on the generations as a rough proxy for fluency. Specifically, we use the Gated Convolutional Language Model BIBREF21 pretrained on WikiText-103.Following BIBREF22 , we compute self-BLEU: for each generated sentence, we compute BLEU treating the rest of the sentences as references, and average across sentences.'
 'Self-BLEU measures how similar each generated sentence is to the other generations; high self-BLEU indicates that the model has low sample diversity.We also evaluate the percentage of $n$ -grams that are unique, when compared to the original data distribution and within the corpus of generations. We note that this metric is somewhat in opposition to BLEU between generations and data, as fewer unique $n$ -grams implies higher BLEU.We use the non-sequential sampling scheme, as empirically this led to the most coherent generations. We show generations from the sequential sampler in Table 4 in the appendix. We compare against generations from a high-quality neural language model, the OpenAI Generative Pre-Training Transformer BIBREF23 , which was trained on TBC and has approximately the same number of parameters as the base configuration of BERT. For all models, we generate 1000 uncased sequences of length 40.Results\tWe present sample generations, quality results, and diversity results respectively in Tables 1 , 2 , 3 .We find that, compared to GPT, the BERT generations are of worse quality, but are more diverse.'
 ""Because the model expects context from both directions, it is not immediately obvious how to efficiently evaluate BERT as a language model (i.e., use it to evaluate the probability of a text sequence) or how to sample from it.We attempt to answer these questions by showing that BERT is a combination of a Markov random field language model BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 with pseudo log-likelihood BIBREF6 training.

We use uni-grams, bi-grams, and tri-grams to capture phrases and context in which words are being used. We then select the top scoring grams to be used as features for the language model. N-grams and words frequency have been used in the literature to classify similar problems, such as hate-speech and extremist text and have proven successful BIBREF16 . The second method we use is word embeddings to capture semantic meanings. Research in NLP has compared the effectiveness of word embedding methods for encoding semantic meaning and found that semantic relationships between words are best captured by word vectors within word embedding models BIBREF17 . Therefore, we train word2vec model on our propaganda corpus to build the lexical semantic aspects of the text using vector space models. We learn word embeddings using skip-gram word2vec model implemented in the gensim package with vector size of 100 and window size of 5. This word embedding model is used to obtain the vector representation for each word.'

The output of this task is a radical corpus of top k-grams, and a word embedding model giving a vector representation for each word in the corpus. The second task seeks to create a psychological profile based on the language used in the extremist propaganda articles, consisting of a set of emotional and topical categories using LIWC dictionary-based tool.

Recent reports show that the mode of operation of these groups starts by exposing a wide audience to extremist material online, before migrating them to less open online platforms for further radicalization. Thus, identifying radical content online is crucial to limit the reach and spread of the extremist narrative. In this paper, our aim is to identify measures to automatically detect radical content in social media. We identify several signals, including textual, psychological and behavioural, that together allow for the classification of radical messages. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) we analyze propaganda material published by extremist groups and create a contextual text-based model of radical content, (2) we build a model of psychological properties inferred from these material, and (3) we evaluate these models on Twitter to determine the extent to which it is possible to automatically identify online radical tweets. Our results show that radical users do exhibit distinguishable textual, psychological, and behavioural properties. We find that the psychological properties are among the most distinguishing features.'
 'We explore three categories of information to identify relevant features to detect radical content. Some features are user-based while others are message-based.

Dabiq is an online magazine published by ISIS terrorist groups with the purpose of recruiting people and promoting their propaganda and ideology. Using this data source, we investigate what topics, textual properties, and linguistic cues exist in these magazines. Our intuition is that utilising these linguistic cues from the extremist propaganda would allow us to detect supporters of ISIS group who are influenced by their propaganda.We use two methods to extract the radical language from the propaganda corpus. First we calculate tf-idf scores for each gram in the propaganda corpus.'
 'This finding is in line with the tactics reported in the radicalization literature with regards to emphasizing the separation between the radical group and the world.Moreover, among the top contributing features are behavioural features related to the number of mentions a single user makes, and their HITS hub and authority rank among their interaction network. This relates to how active the user is in interacting with other users and how much attention they receive from their community. This links to the objectives of those radical users in spreading their ideologies and reaching out to potential like-minded people. As for the INLINEFORM0 category, we find that the use of word2vec embedding improves the performance in comparison with using the tf-idf features. Additionally, all bi-grams and tri-grams features did not contribute much to the classification; only uni-grams did. This can be related to the differences in the writing styles when constructing sentences and phrases in articles and in the social media context (especially given the limitation of the number of words allowed by the Twitter platform). Additionally, the violent word ratio, longWords, and allCaps features are among the top contributing features from this category.']","  Based on the analysis of extremist propaganda material published by ISIS terrorist groups in Dabiq magazine, we observe the following textual, psychological, and behavioral patterns in radical users:

2. Emphasis on separation from the outside world and emphasis on the group's uniqueness and exclusivity.

 'Imitation learning BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , though also exploiting metrics, requires access to an expert policy, with exact policies not directly computable for the metrics of interest.In this work, we aim at combining the best of both worlds by proposing a simple method that can turn popular coreference evaluation metrics into differentiable functions of model parameters. As we show, this function can be computed recursively using scores of individual local decisions, resulting in a simple and efficient estimation procedure. The key idea is to replace non-differentiable indicator functions (e.g. the member function INLINEFORM0 ) with the corresponding posterior probabilities ( INLINEFORM1 ) computed by the model. Consequently, non-differentiable functions used within the metrics (e.g. the set size function INLINEFORM2 ) become differentiable ( INLINEFORM3 ). Though we assume that the scores of the underlying statistical model can be used to define a probability model, we show that this is not a serious limitation.'

 'The issue of domain definition is overcome by the use of IR techniques which use the characteristic vocabulary of the domain to query a Lucene search engine over the entire corpus. The candidate sentences are defined based on word overlap and the decision whether a sentence pair is parallel or not using the maximum entropy classifier. The difference in the BLEU scores between out of domain and domain-specific translation is proved clearly using the word embeddings from characteristic vocabulary extracted using the extracted additional bitexts. BIBREF2 ( BIBREF2 ) extract parallel sentences without the use of a classifier. Target language candidate sentences are found using the translation of source side comparable corpora. Sentence tail removal is used to strip the tail parts of sentence pairs which differ only at the end. This, along with the use of parallel sentences enhanced the BLEU score and helped to determine if the translated source sentence and candidate target sentence are parallel by measuring the word and translation error rate. This method succeeds in eliminating the need for domain specific text by using the target side as a source of candidate sentences.'

51,How are labels for trolls obtained?,"['Thus, any supervised machine learning approach would fall short of being a fully automated solution to our initial problem.A more realistic scenario assumes that labels for troll accounts are not available. In this case, we need to use some external information in order to learn a labeling function. Indeed, we leverage more persistent entities and their labels: news media. We assume a learning scenario with distant supervision where labels for news media are available. By combining these labels with a citation graph from the troll accounts to news media, we can infer the final labeling on the accounts themselves without any need for manual labeling.One advantage of using distant supervision is that we can get insights about the behavior of a newly-discovered troll farm quickly and effortlessly. Differently from troll accounts in social media, which usually have a high churn rate, news media accounts in social media are quite stable. Therefore, the latter can be used as an anchor point to understand the behavior of trolls, for which data may not be available.We rely on embeddings extracted from social media.'
 'This suggests that the relationship between trolls and media goes both ways, and thus we can use labels for media as a way to label users, and we can also use labels for troll users as a way to label media.Conclusion and Future Work\tWe have proposed a novel approach to analyze the behavior patterns of political trolls according to their political leaning (left vs. news feed vs. right) using features from social media, i.e., from Twitter. We experimented with two scenarios: (i) supervised learning, where labels for trolls are provided, and (ii) distant supervision, where such labels are not available, and we rely on more common labels for news outlets cited by the trolls.

This is impressive considering that the models for T2 have no access to labels for troll users.Looking at individual features, for both T1 and T2, the embeddings from U2M outperform those from U2H and from BERT. One possible reason is that the U2M graph is larger, and thus contains more information. It is also possible that the social circle of a troll user is more indicative than the hashtags they used. Finally, the textual content on Twitter is quite noisy, and thus the BERT embeddings perform slightly worse when used alone.All our models with a single type of embedding easily outperform the model of BIBREF2.'

57,"Do they attempt to jointly learn connectives, arguments, senses and non-explicit identiifers end-to-end?","['The connective itself is a very good feature because discourse connective almost determine senses. So we train an explicit classifier using simple but effective features.Non-explicit Identifier\tThe non-explicit relation is the relation between adjacent sentences in same para-graph. So we just check adjacent sentences which don’t form explicit relation and then label them with non-explicit relation or nothing. In the experiment, we find that the two arguments of non-explicit relation have association with each other and also have some common words. So we introduce feature words, which indicate appear-ance of relation, like “it, them”.Experiments\tIn our experiments, we make use of the Section 02-21 in the PDTB as training set, Section 22 as testing set. All of components adopt maximum entropy model. In order to evaluate the performance of the discourse parser, we compare it with other approaches: (1) Baseline_1, which applies the probability information. The connective identifier predicts the connective according the frequency of the connec-tive in the train set.'
 'The sense classifier labels the dis-course relation. The non-explicit identifier checks all the pair of adjacent sentences. If the non-explicit identifier indentifies the pair of sentences as non-explicit relation, it will label it the relation sense. Though many research work BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 are committed to the shallow discourse parsing field, all of them are focus on the subtask of parsing only rather than the whole parsing process. Given all that, a full shallow discourse parser framework is proposed in our paper to turn the free text into discourse relations set. The parser includes connective identifier, arguments identifier, sense classifier and non-explicit identifier, which connects with each other in pipeline. In order to enhance the performance of the parser, the feature-based maximum entropy model approach is adopted in the experiment. Maximum entropy model offers a clean way to combine diverse pieces of contextual evidence in order to estimate the probability of a certain linguistic class occurring with a certain linguistic context in a simple and accessible manner.

 'Next, each component of the parser will be described in detail. Connective Identifier\tThe main duty of this component is disambiguate the connective words which are in PDTB predefined set. Pitler and Nenkova citePitlerN09 show that syntactic features are very useful on disambiguate discourse connective, so we adopt these syntactic fea-tures as part of our features. Ziheng Lin et al. LinKN09 show that a connective’s context and part-of-speech (POS) gives a very strong indication of discourse usage. The table 1 shows the feature we use.Arguments Identifier\tOn this step, we adopt the head-based thinking BIBREF12 , which turns the problem of identifying arguments of discourse connective into identifying the head and end of the arguments. First, we need to extract the candidates of arguments.']","  Based on the given context information, it appears that the authors of the paper are proposing a full shallow discourse parser framework that includes four components: connective identifier, arguments identifier, sense classifier, and non-explicit identifier. The framework is designed to turn free text into discourse relations sets.

To answer your query, the authors do not explicitly mention attempting to jointly learn connectives, arguments, senses, and non-explicit identifiers end-to-end. However, they do discuss using a feature-based maximum entropy model approach to enhance the performance of the parser. This suggests that the components of the parser may be learned or trained together, rather than separately.

Additionally, the authors mention that the three main contributions of the paper are: (1) proposing a full shallow discourse parser framework, (2) adopting a feature-based maximum entropy model approach, and (3) integrating four components to enhance the performance of the parser. This suggests that the four components are intended to work together to achieve the goal of parsing discourse relations from free text.

Self-attention is able to model long-term dependencies, but it may suffer from the extraction of irrelevant information in the context. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel model called \\textbf{Explicit Sparse Transformer}. Explicit Sparse Transformer is able to improve the concentration of attention on the global context through an explicit selection of the most relevant segments. Extensive experimental results on a series of natural language processing and computer vision tasks, including neural machine translation, image captioning, and language modeling, all demonstrate the advantages of Explicit Sparse Transformer in model performance. We also show that our proposed sparse attention method achieves comparable or better results than the previous sparse attention method, but significantly reduces training and testing time. For example, the inference speed is twice that of sparsemax in Transformer model. Code will be available at \\url{this https URL}\tIntroduction\tUnderstanding natural language requires the ability to pay attention to the most relevant information.'
 'The masking functions $\\mathcal {M}(\\cdot , \\cdot )$ is illustrated as follows:With the top-$k$ selection, the high attention scores are selected through an explicit way. This is different from dropout which randomly abandons the scores. Such explicit selection can not only guarantee the preservation of important components, but also simplify the model since $k$ is usually a small number such as 8, detailed analysis can be found in SECREF28. The next step after top-$k$ selection is normalization:where $A$ refers to the normalized scores. As the scores that are smaller than the top k largest scores are assigned with negative infinity by the masking function $\\mathcal {M}(\\cdot , \\cdot )$, their normalized scores, namely the probabilities, approximate 0. We show the back-propagation process of Top-k selection in SECREF50. The output representation of self-attention $C$ can be computed as below:The output is the expectation of the value following the sparsified distribution $A$. Following the distribution of the selected components, the attention in the Explicit Sparse Transformer model can obtain more focused attention.'

When backpropagating,The softmax function is evidently differentiable, therefore, we have calculated the gradient involved in top-k selection.Appendix ::: Implementation\tFigure FIGREF56 shows the code for the idea in case of single head self-attention, the proposed method is easy to implement and plug in the successful Transformer model.']","  Based on the provided context information, it seems that ""explicit selection of most relevant segments"" refers to a method for selecting the most important parts of the input data when using self-attention in a Transformer model. This is done through an explicit way of choosing the top-$k$ highest attention scores, rather than relying on random dropout or other methods. The selected segments are then normalized to ensure that all components have a similar scale, and the attention is focused on these segments to obtain more concentrated attention.

In other words, the ""explicit selection of most relevant segments"" means that the model explicitly chooses which parts of the input data are most relevant for the current task, rather than relying on randomness or default settings. This allows the model to focus its attention on the most important parts of the input data and improve its performance.","['It is meant that only most contributive k elements are reserved'

The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal.In the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme.""
 'All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold).For specific tasks, we also design a semantic slot annotation scheme for annotating sentences based on their semantic content. We identify 13 main semantic slots in the anti-scam task, for example, credit card numbers. We present a detailed semantic slot annotation in Table TABREF3. Following BIBREF1, we segment each conversation turn into single sentences and then annotate each sentence rather than turns.Datasets\tWe test our approach on two non-collaborative task datasets: the AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1.'

However, the real mapping between human-intent and system-intent is much more complicated as there might be multiple acceptable system-intents for the same human-intent. Therefore, we also design a metric to evaluate if the predicted system-intent is in the set of acceptable intents. Specifically, we estimate the transition probability $p(I_i|I_j)$ by counting the frequency of all the bi-gram human-intent and system-intent pairs in the training data. During the test stage, if the predicted intent matches the ground truth, we set the score as 1, otherwise we set the score as $p(I_{predict}|I_i)$ where $I_i$ is the intent of the input human utterance.']","  Based on the provided context information, I can answer your query about intent annotation as follows:

In the context of dialog systems and natural language processing, intent annotation refers to the process of labeling or tagging specific intents or goals within a conversation or text. This annotation helps the system understand the purpose or objective behind each utterance or statement, which can then be used to generate appropriate responses or take relevant actions.

In the AntiScam and PersuasionForGood datasets, intent annotation is done using a hierarchical scheme, where on-task intents are defined for each dataset, and off-task intents are categorized into general and social intents. On-task intents are specific to the task at hand and are related to the main actions or goals of the conversation, while off-task intents are more general and can be applied to various conversations.

The intent annotation scheme for the AntiScam dataset includes elicitation, providing information, and refusal as on-task intents, while the PersuasionForGood dataset has nine on-task intents related to donation actions.

Individuals unknowingly create a unique knowledge base with these images. The food images, in particular, are of interest as they contain a plethora of information. From the image metadata and using computer vision tools, we can extract distinct insights for each user to build a personal profile. Using the underlying connection between cuisines and their inherent tastes, we attempt to develop such a profile for an individual based solely on the images of his food. Our study provides insights about an individual's inclination towards particular cuisines. Interpreting these insights can lead to the development of a more precise recommendation system. Such a system would avoid the generic approach in favor of a personalized recommendation system.\tINTRODUCTION\tA picture is worth a thousand words. Complex ideas can easily be depicted via an image. An image is a mine of data in the 21st century. With each person taking an average of 20 photographs every day, the number of photographs taken around the world each year is astounding.""

Pretrained models can be fine-tuned on natural language processing (NLP) tasks and have achieved significant improvements over training on task-specific annotated data. More recently, a pretraining technique named bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) BIBREF12 was proposed and has enabled the creation of state-of-the-art models for a wide variety of NLP tasks, including question answering (SQuAD v1.1) and natural language inference, among others.However, there have not been many efforts in exploring pretrained language representations for few-shot text classification.'
 'Improving Few-shot Text Classification via Pretrained Language Representations.\tText classification tends to be difficult when the data is deficient or when it is required to adapt to unseen classes. In such challenging scenarios, recent studies have often used meta-learning to simulate the few-shot task, thus negating explicit common linguistic features across tasks. Deep language representations have proven to be very effective forms of unsupervised pretraining, yielding contextualized features that capture linguistic properties and benefit downstream natural language understanding tasks. However, the effect of pretrained language representation for few-shot learning on text classification tasks is still not well understood. In this study, we design a few-shot learning model with pretrained language representations and report the empirical results. We show that our approach is not only simple but also produces state-of-the-art performance on a well-studied sentiment classification dataset. It can thus be further suggested that pretraining could be a promising solution for few shot learning of many other NLP tasks.

 'Contemporary approaches to few-shot learning often decompose the training procedure into an auxiliary meta-learning phase, which includes many sub-tasks, following the principle that the testing and training conditions must match.

Here we alleviate this problem by empowering a relation extraction method with additional evidence from Wikipedia. We first present a neural network based relation extractor to retrieve the candidate answers from Freebase, and then infer over Wikipedia to validate these answers. Experiments on the WebQuestions question answering dataset show that our method achieves an F_1 of 53.3%, a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art.\tIntroduction\tSince the advent of large structured knowledge bases (KBs) like Freebase BIBREF0 , YAGO BIBREF1 and DBpedia BIBREF2 , answering natural language questions using those structured KBs, also known as KB-based question answering (or KB-QA), is attracting increasing research efforts from both natural language processing and information retrieval communities.The state-of-the-art methods for this task can be roughly categorized into two streams.'

Inspired by the recent success of neural network models in KB question-answering BIBREF16 , BIBREF12 , and the success of syntactic dependencies for relation extraction BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , we propose a Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Network (MCCNN) which could exploit both syntactic and sentential information for relation extraction.In MCCNN, we use two channels, one for syntactic information and the other for sentential information.

Relation extraction methods typically answer with all the mountains in North America because of the lack of sophisticated representation for the mathematical function highest. To select the correct answer, one has to retrieve all the heights of the mountains, and sort them in descending order, and then pick the first entry. We propose a method based on textual evidence which can answer such questions without solving the mathematic functions implicitly.Knowledge bases like Freebase capture real world facts, and Web resources like Wikipedia provide a large repository of sentences that validate or support these facts. For example, a sentence in Wikipedia says, Denali (also known as Mount McKinley, its former official name) is the highest mountain peak in North America, with a summit elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190 m) above sea level. To answer our example question against a KB using a relation extractor, we can use this sentence as external evidence, filter out wrong answers and pick the correct one.Using textual evidence not only mitigates representational issues in relation extraction, but also alleviates the data scarcity problem to some extent.

94,What are the solutions proposed for the seq2seq shortcomings?,"['Towards better decoding and language model integration in sequence to sequence models\tThe recently proposed Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) framework advocates replacing complex data processing pipelines, such as an entire automatic speech recognition system, with a single neural network trained in an end-to-end fashion. In this contribution, we analyse an attention-based seq2seq speech recognition system that directly transcribes recordings into characters. We observe two shortcomings: overconfidence in its predictions and a tendency to produce incomplete transcriptions when language models are used. We propose practical solutions to both problems achieving competitive speaker independent word error rates on the Wall Street Journal dataset: without separate language models we reach 10.6% WER, while together with a trigram language model, we reach 6.7% WER.\tIntroduction\tDeep learning BIBREF0 has led to many breakthroughs including speech and image recognition BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 .'
 'A subfamily of deep models, the Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) neural networks have proved to be very successful on complex transduction tasks, such as machine translation BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , speech recognition BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , and lip-reading BIBREF13 . Seq2seq networks can typically be decomposed into modules that implement stages of a data processing pipeline: an encoding module that transforms its inputs into a hidden representation, a decoding (spelling) module which emits target sequences and an attention module that computes a soft alignment between the hidden representation and the targets. Training directly maximizes the probability of observing desired outputs conditioned on the inputs. This discriminative training mode is fundamentally different from the generative ""noisy channel"" formulation used to build classical state-of-the art speech recognition systems. As such, it has benefits and limitations that are different from classical ASR systems.Understanding and preventing limitations specific to seq2seq models is crucial for their successful development. Discriminative training allows seq2seq models to focus on the most informative features.'
 'Discriminative training allows seq2seq models to focus on the most informative features. However, it also increases the risk of overfitting to those few distinguishing characteristics. We have observed that seq2seq models often yield very sharp predictions, and only a few hypotheses need to be considered to find the most likely transcription of a given utterance. However, high confidence reduces the diversity of transcripts obtained using beam search.During typical training the models are conditioned on ground truth transcripts and are scored on one-step ahead predictions. By itself, this training criterion does not ensure that all relevant fragments of the input utterance are transcribed. Subsequently, mistakes that are introduced during decoding may cause the model to skip some words and jump to another place in the recording. The problem of incomplete transcripts is especially apparent when external language models are used.Model Description\tOur speech recognition system, builds on the recently proposed Listen, Attend and Spell network BIBREF12 . It is an attention-based seq2seq model that is able to directly transcribe an audio recording INLINEFORM0 into a space-delimited sequence of characters INLINEFORM1 .']","  Based on the given context information, the solutions proposed for the shortcomings of the attention-based seq2seq speech recognition system are as follows:

1. To address the overconfidence issue, the authors propose using a ""soft"" attention mechanism that allows the model to consider multiple hypotheses when making predictions. This helps to increase the diversity of transcripts obtained using beam search and reduces the risk of overfitting to a single hypothesis.
2. To address the incomplete transcriptions issue, the authors propose using an additional language model to generate more complete transcripts. They show that incorporating a trigram language model into the system leads to competitive speaker-independent word error rates (WER) of 6.7% on the Wall Street Journal dataset.

These solutions aim to improve the performance and robustness of the attention-based seq2seq speech recognition system by addressing its limitations in overconfidence and incomplete transcriptions.",['Unacceptable'],1.0,0.9454330829175056,0.9999999999666667,0.0

Since the FEVER claims are masked to generate the questions, we use BERT to tokenize the claims. We observed that the BERT tokenizer sometimes fails to tokenize the named entities correctly (e.g. Named entity “Taran” was tokenized as “Tara”, “##n”). This is due to the insufficient vocabulary used while training the WordPiece tokenizer.To resolve this, we use Spacy Tokenizer whenever the WordPiece Tokenizer fails. Once the claim is tokenized, we use the PyTorch Implementation of the BERT model (BertForMaskedLM model) to predict the vocabulary index of the masked token. The predicted vocabulary index is then converted to the actual token.'

Later when the answers are generated, due to the question generation process, it becomes very easy to identify the correct answers.We use the BERT's (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) (BIBREF8) masked language model, that is pre-trained on Wikipedia articles for predicting the masked entities. Currently, neither the claim verification process nor the question generation process mandates explicit reasoning. For the same reason, it is difficult to put “REFUTES” or “NOT ENOUGH INFO” labels. To resolve this issue, we classify the unsupported claims as “MANUAL_REVIEW” instead of labeling them as “NOT ENOUGH INFO” or “REFUTES”.In the literature, the shared task has been tackled using pipeline-based supervised models (BIBREF9; BIBREF10; BIBREF11). To our knowledge, only BIBREF10 has provided the confusion matrix for each of the labels for their supervised system.""
 ""This was one of the most recurring error types.Limitations of Tokenizer. The WordPiece tokenizer splits the token into multiple tokens. E.g. “Taran” into “Tara”, “##n”. In such cases, the answering system predicts the first token only which would be a substring of the correct answer. As we don't explicitly put a rule to avoid such cases, they are considered as incorrect answers.Conclusion\tIn this paper, we presented a transformer-based unsupervised question-answering pipeline to solve the fact checking task.

According to the information provided in the context, the retrieval-based dialog system in the experiment achieves better performance than RNN-based sequence generation. The retrieval system is faster than RNNs in terms of inference time, as it uses a pre-trained language model to retrieve relevant information from a large corpus of text. This suggests that the retrieval-based method is more efficient in terms of computation time compared to RNN-based methods.

Additionally, the authors of the paper compare their method with other state-of-the-practice dialog systems and show that their approach achieves better performance in terms of both human evaluation and BLEU scores. This suggests that the retrieval-based method is more effective in generating high-quality responses compared to other methods.

123,How does sentence construction component works?,"['It acts as the coordinator for all other succeeding rules.Given the seed components identified in Section SECREF15 and the above GF rules, a GF grammar for each sentence can be constructed. However, this grammar can only be used to generate fairly simple sentences. For example, for the sentence “Bill plays a popular board game with his close friends.”, a GF grammar for structure #2 can be constructed, which can only generate the sentence “Bill plays game.” because it does not contain any complement components identified in Section SECREF15. Therefore, we assgin a set of GF rules for the construction of each parameter in the GF rules in Table TABREF19. The set of GF rules has to follow two conventions. The first one is after applying the set of rules to some components of the sentence, the type of the production is one of the type in Table TABREF19, e.g. $NP$, $VP$, $Cl$, $V2$, .... The second convention is that the GF encoder will select the rules as the order from top to bottom in Table TABREF20.'
 'For example, the sentence “Bill plays a game” is encoded by a structure #2 and we expect that Bill, plays, and game correspond to the subject, verb, and object, respectively.We begin with recognizing the main words (components) that play the most important roles in the sentence based on a given sentence structure. This is achieved by program $\\Pi _2$ (Listing ). The first four rules of $\\Pi _2$ determine the main subject and verb of the sentence whose structure is #1, #2, #3, or #5. Structure #4 requires a special treatment since the components following tobe can be of different forms. For instance, in “Cathy is gorgeous,” the part after tobe is an adjective, but in “Cathy is a beautiful girl,” the part after tobe is a noun, though, with adjective beautiful. This is done using the four last rules of $\\Pi _2$.The result of program $\\Pi _2$ is an one-to-one mapping of some of the words in the sentence into the importaint components of a sentence, called main components, i.e.'
 'Our system is developed to emulate the process of a person learning a new language and has to make guesses to understand new sentences from time to time. For example, someone, who understands the sentence “Bill plays a game” would not fully understand the sentence “Bill plays a popular board game” without knowing the meaning of “popular” and “board game” but could infer that the latter sentence indicates that its subject plays a type of game.The overall design of our system is given in Figure FIGREF7. Given a paragraph, our system produces a GF program (a pair of an abstract and a concrete syntax), which can be used for sentence generation. The system consists of two components, understanding sentences and generating GF grammar. The first component is divided into two sub-components, one for recognizing the sentence structure and one for recognizing the sentence components. The second component consists of a GF grammar encoder and a GF grammar exporter.']","  Based on the provided context information, the sentence construction component of the system works by using a set of GF rules to generate sentences based on the structure of the input sentence. The GF rules are organized in a table (TABREF19) and follow two conventions:

1. After applying the set of rules to some components of the sentence, the type of the production is one of the types in Table TABREF19, such as $NP$, $VP$, $Cl$, $V2$, etc.
2. The GF encoder will select the rules in the order from top to bottom in Table TABREF20.

124,What are two use cases that demonstrate capability of created system?,"['The paper includes two use cases to demostrate the capability of the system. As the sentence construction is done via GF, the paper includes a use case evaluation showing that the proposed system could also be utilized in addressing a challenge to create an abstract Wikipedia, which is recently discussed in the BlueSky session of the 2018 International Semantic Web Conference.\tIntroduction\tNatural language generation (NLG) has been one of the key topics of research in natural language processing, which was highlighted by the huge body of work on NLG surveyed in BIBREF0, BIBREF1. With the advances of several devices capable of understanding spoken language and conducting conversation with human (e.g., Google Home, Amazon Echo) and the shrinking gap created by the digital devices, it is not difficult to foresee that the market and application areas of NLG systems will continue to grow, especially in applications whose users are non-experts. In such application, a user often asks for certain information and waits for the answer and a NLG module would return the answer in spoken language instead of text such as in question-answering systems or recommendation systems. The NLG system in these two applications uses templates to generate the answers in natural language for the users.'
 'BIBREF20 (BIBREF20) describes a system that can give reasonable and supportive evidence to the answer to a question asked to an image, while BIBREF4 (BIBREF4) generates explanations for scheduling problem using argumentation. BIBREF21 (BIBREF21) use ASP to develop a system answering questions in the do-it-yourself domain. These papers use templates to generate answers. The generated GF program generated by our system, that is used for the NLG task, is automatically created from a provided input.The sophisticated system presented by BIBREF5 translates both question and the given natural language text to logical representation, and uses logical reasoning to produce the answer. Our system is similar to their system in that both employ recent developments of NLP into solving NLG problems.Conclusions and Future Work\tWe propose a system implemented using answer set programming (ASP) and Grammatical Framework (GF), for automatic generation of natural language descriptions in applications targeting mainstream users.'
 'Table TABREF27 shows the summary of the number of assessable sentences from our system. Out of 62 sentences from 3 portals, the system cannot determine the structure 2 sentences in Mathematics due to their complexity. This low number of failure shows that our 5 proposed sentence structures effectively act as a lower bound on sentence recognition module.In terms of quality, Table TABREF28 shows the average of BLEU and ROUGE score for each portal. Note that the average BLUE score is calculated only on BLEU assessable sentences, while average ROUGE score is calculated on the sentences whose structure can be recognized and encoded by our system. We note that the BLEU or ROUGE score might not be sufficiently high for a good quality translation. We believe that two reasons contribute to this low score. First, the present system uses fairly simple sentence structures. Second, it does not consider the use of relative clauses to enrich the sentences. This feature will be added to the next version of the system.Table TABREF32 summarizes the result of this use case.']","  Based on the provided context information, the two use cases that demonstrate the capability of the created system are:

The initial lower bounds are derived from the Beam-10 hypothesis INLINEFORM2 as follows: DISPLAYFORM0 Exact search under length normalization does not suffer from the length deficiency anymore (last row in Tab. TABREF19 ), but it is not able to match our best BLEU score under Beam-10 search. This suggests that while length normalization biases search towards translations of roughly the correct length, it does not fix the fundamental modelling problem.Related Work\tOther researchers have also noted that large beam sizes yield shorter translations BIBREF19 .'

The context mentions that the search space is constrained to translations longer than 0.25 times the source sentence length, and that exact search is conducted on only a subset of the test set to keep the runtime under control. Additionally, the context mentions that the oracle experiment was conducted on the full dataset, which suggests that the test set size is smaller than the full dataset.

 'This is connected with the fact that the dialogue structure is more complex – information is spread in multiple utterances, discussions, questions, more typos and slang words appear there, posing new challenges for summarization. On the other hand, dialogues are divided into utterances, and for each utterance its author is assigned. We demonstrate in experiments that the models benefit from the introduction of separators, which mark utterances for each person. This suggests that dedicated models having some architectural changes, taking into account the assignation of a person to an utterance in a systematic manner, could improve the quality of dialogue summarization.We show that the most popular summarization metric ROUGE does not reflect the quality of a summary. Looking at the ROUGE scores, one concludes that the dialogue summarization models perform better than the ones for news summarization.

 'The accuracy was not that good and they did not bother to calculate it. Also, due to the integrated nature of conversational interaction in Persona, the necessary knowledge must be provided to each component of the system. Although it had limitations, it provided a very usable linguistic foundation for conversational interaction.The researchers thought that if they can create assistant models specific to the corresponding models, they can achieve better accuracy for those applications instead of creating a common unified personal assistant which at that time performed quite poorly. There was a surge in application-specific assistants like in-car intelligent personal assistant (Schillo et al, 1996 BIBREF5 ), spoken-language interface to execute military exercises (Stent et al, 1999 BIBREF6 ), etc. Since it was difficult to develop systems with high domain extensibility, the researchers came up with a distributed architecture for cooperative spoken dialogue agents (Lin et al, 1999 BIBREF7 ).Under this architecture, different spoken dialogue agents handling different domains can be developed independently and cooperate with one another to respond to the user’s requests.'

151,What metrics are typically used to compare models?,"['Similarly, the metrics that are embedding-based consist of basic averages of vectors obtained through distributional semantics and so they are also insufficiently complex for modeling sentence-level compositionality in dialogue.The metrics that take into account the context can also be considered. Such metrics can come in the form of an evaluation model that is learned from data. This model can be either a discriminative model that attempts to distinguish between model and human responses or a model that uses data collected from the human survey in order to provide human-like scores to proposed responses.Conclusion\tIn this survey paper we explored the exciting and rapidly changing field of conversational agents. We talked about the early rule-based methods that depended on hand-engineered features. These methods laid the ground work for the current models. However these models were expensive to create and the features depended on the domain that the conversational agent was created for. It was hard to modify these models for a new domain. As computation power increased, and we developed neural networks that were able to capture long range dependencies (RNNs,GRUs,LSTMs) the field moved towards neural models for building these agents.'

Large online corpora are helpful for this. However several dialogue corpora, most notably those extracted from subtitles, do not include any explicit turn segmentation or speaker identification.The neural conversation model may therefore inadvertently learn responses that remain within the same dialogue turn instead of starting a new turn. Lison et al BIBREF17 overcome these limitations by introduce a weighting model into the neural architecture. The weighting model, which is itself estimated from dialogue data, associates each training example to a numerical weight that reflects its intrinsic quality for dialogue modelling. At training time, these sample weights are included into the empirical loss to be minimized.

3. Distributed sentence representations: This metric measures the similarity between the generated response and a set of reference responses based on the distribution of words in the sentences, with more similar distributions indicating better performance.
4. Weighting model: This metric uses a weighting function to associate each training example with a numerical weight that reflects its intrinsic quality for dialogue modelling, with higher weights indicating better performance.

It is important to note that these metrics have limitations and may not accurately reflect the performance of the model in all situations. Therefore, it is recommended to use multiple metrics and consider human evaluations to get a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.",['Unacceptable'],0.4,0.9225592716748755,0.0,0.0

Then they put those features in the binary MaxEnt classifier. For this, their model was able to achieve an error rate of 25.1% for the dialog act classification which was better than the best performing models at that time. Although, according to the modern standards, the results are not that great but the approach they suggested (of using data to build machine learning models) forms the basis of the techniques that are currently used in this area.Sequence to Sequence approaches for dialogue modelling\tThe problem with rule-based models was that they were often domain dependent and could not be easily ported to a new domain. They also depended on hand crafted rules which was both expensive and required domain expertise. Two factors which when combined spell doom for scalbility.'

They chose not to include any discounting factor to the dialog score as they progressed back through the dialog history. The decision to equally weight each state-action pair in the dialog history was made because an action’s contribution to the dialog score is not dependent upon its proximity to the end of the task. In order to combat the problem of converging to an effective policy they divided up the agent training process into multiple epochs.The average objective function score for the case of learned policies was 44.90. One of the main reasons for the low accuracy (which is also a limitation of this paper) was that there were a number of aspects of dialog that they had not modeled such as non-understandings, misunderstandings, and even parsing sentences into the action specification and generating sentences from the action specification.']","  Based on the provided context information, there is no direct mention of a benchmark for comparing different approaches in the paper by Srinivas et al.

153,What GAN and RL approaches are used?,"['The agent suffers from the cold start issue. In the case of end-to-end learning, they found that for a moderately sized knowledge base, the agent almost always fails if starting from random initialization.Actor-Critic Algorithm\tDeep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have significant potential for dialogue policy optimisation. However, they suffer from a poor performance in the early stages of learning as we saw in the paper in the above section. This is especially problematic for on-line learning with real users.In the paper by Su et al, 2017 BIBREF27 , they proposed a sample-efficient actor-critic reinforcement learning with supervised data for dialogue management. Just for a heads up, actor-critic algorithms are the algorithms that have an actor stores the policy according to which the action is taken by the agent and a critic that critiques the actions chosen by the actor (that is, the rewards obtained after the action are sent to the critic using which it calculates value functions).To speed up the learning process, they presented two sample-efficient neural networks algorithms: trust region actor-critic with experience replay (TRACER) and episodic natural actor-critic with experience replay (eNACER).'
 'Both models employ off-policy learning with experience replay to improve sample-efficiency. For TRACER, the trust region helps to control the learning step size and avoid catastrophic model changes. For eNACER, the natural gradient identifies the steepest ascent direction in policy space to speed up the convergence.To mitigate the cold start issue, a corpus of demonstration data was utilised to pre-train the models prior to on-line reinforcement learning. Combining these two approaches, they demonstrated a practical approach to learn deep RL-based dialogue policies and also demonstrated their effectiveness in a task-oriented information seeking domain.We can see in the figure FIGREF11 that the success rate reaches at around 95% for the case of policy trained with corpus data and using reinforcement learning which is impressive. Also, they train very quickly. For instance, for training just around 500-1000 dialogues, eNACER has a success rate of around 95% and TRACER has a success rate of around 92%. However, the authors noted that performance falls off rather rapidly in noise as the uncertainty estimates are not handled well by neural networks architectures.'

These works argue that a language model is better suited to dialogue modeling, as it learns how the conversation evolves as information progresses.Mei et al. BIBREF19 improve the coherence of such neural dialogue language models by developing a generative dynamic attention mechanism that allows each generated word to choose which related words it wants to align to in the increasing conversation history (including the previous words in the response being generated). They introduce a dynamic attention mechanism to a RNN language model in which the scope of attention increases as the recurrence operation progresses from the start through the end of the conversation.'

Their work is important in terms of the techniques they used.The speech recognition was done using n-gram statistical model which is then passed to a robust parser based on an extended Context Free Grammar allowing the system to skip unknown words and perform partial parsing. They wrote the grammar based on a combination of their own intuition and a small scale Wizard-of-Oz experiment they ran. The grammar rules used to identify bus stops were generated automatically from the schedule database. After this, they trained a statistical language model on the artificial corpus. In order to make the parsing grammar robust enough to parse fairly ungrammatical, yet understandable sentences, it was kept as general as possible. On making it public, they initially achieved a task success rate of 43.3% for the whole corpus and 43.6 when excluding sessions that did not contain any system-directed speech.After this they tried to increase the performance of the system (Raux et al, 2006 BIBREF10 ). They retrained their acoustic models by performing Baum-Welch optimization on the transcribed data (starting from their original models).'
 'Hence, their model generates more informative responses.

Exploring how to obtain credible knowledge of a given dialog history can be a future generation of their model.Reinforcement Learning based models\tAfter exploring the neural methods in a lot of detail, the researchers have also begun exploring, in the current decade, how to use the reinforcement learning methods in the dialogue and personal agents.Initial reinforcement methods\tOne of the first main papers that thought of using reinforcement learning for this came in 2005 by English et al BIBREF25 .

Finally, we also report the performance of a regular-expression-based method which we used during development, based on common ways of expressing dissatisfaction that we observed in our pilot studies, see Appendix SECREF12 for details.As shown by Table TABREF22 , even with only 1k training examples (the amount we used for the experiments in Section SECREF18 ), the trained classifier significantly outperforms both the uncertainty-based methods and our original regular expression, by as much as 0.28 and 0.42 F1 points, respectively.Future Work\tIn this work we achieved learning from dialogue using two types of self-feeding: imitation of satisfied user messages, and learning from the feedback of unsatisfied users. In actuality, there are even more ways a model could learn to improve itself—for example, learning which question to ask in a given context to receive the most valuable feedback.'
 'We leave further exploration of this observation for future work.The same experiment repeated for HB Dialogue examples found that fresher HB examples were no more valuable than stale ones, matching our intuition that HB Dialogue examples are less targeted at current model failure modes than Feedback ones.Predicting User Satisfaction\tFor maximum efficiency, we aim to ask for feedback when it will most benefit our model. The approach we chose (classifying the tone of partner responses) takes advantage of the fact that it is easier to recognize that a mistake has already been made than it is to avoid making that mistake; or in other words, sentiment classification is generally an easier task than next utterance prediction.We compare this to the approach of asking for feedback whenever the model is most uncertain what to say next. This approach acts on the assumption that the model will be least confident when it is about to make a mistake, which we find very frequently to not be the case.'

The approach used in this study involved training a classifier on the Satisfaction task using just 1k training examples, which significantly outperformed both uncertainty-based methods and a regular expression-based method based on common ways of expressing dissatisfaction.

To estimate user satisfaction, the model uses sentiment classification to identify when a user is dissatisfied with the response given by the chatbot. The model then asks for feedback from the user to improve its performance. The approach chosen for this study was to classify the tone of partner responses, as it is easier to recognize when a mistake has been made than to avoid making that mistake.

The study also explored the effect of data freshness on satisfaction and found that fresher HB examples were not more valuable than stale ones in improving the model's performance. Additionally, the study compared the approach of asking for feedback whenever the model is most uncertain what to say next with the approach of classifying the tone of partner responses, and found that the latter approach outperformed the former.",['Unacceptable'],1.0,0.934508229588589,0.99999999995,0.0

Including these responses in the 60k HB dataset decreases hits@1/20 by 1.2 points and 0.6 points when added to 20k and 131k HH Dialogue examples, respectively. We also explored using chatbot responses with favorable satisfaction scores ( INLINEFORM0 ) as new training examples, but found that our models performed better without them (see Appendix SECREF10 for details).We also found that “fresher” feedback results in bigger gains. We compared two models trained on 20k HH Dialogue examples and 40k Feedback examples—the first collected all 40k Feedback examples at once, whereas the second was retrained with its first 20k Feedback examples before collecting the remaining 20k.'

Statistical significance for improvement over baselines is assessed with a two-sample one-tailed T-test.Benefiting from Deployment Examples\tOur main result, reported in Table TABREF16 , is that utilizing the deployment examples improves accuracy on the Dialogue task regardless of the number of available supervised (HH) Dialogue examples. The boost in quality is naturally most pronounced when the HH Dialogue training set is small (i.e., where the learning curve is steepest), yielding an increase of up to 9.4 accuracy points, a 31% improvement. However, even when the entire PersonaChat dataset of 131k examples is used—a much larger dataset than what is available for most dialogue tasks—adding deployment examples is still able to provide an additional 1.6 points of accuracy on what is otherwise a very flat region of the learning curve.'

1. Initialize the tour: Start with an empty tour and set the current node to the first node in the graph.
2. While there are still unvisited nodes:
a. Find the next node: Select the next node that is closest to the current node based on the distance metric used for the graph (e.g., Euclidean distance).
b. Add the next node to the tour: Add the selected node to the tour and set it as the current node.
c. Update the distances: Update the distances between the current node and all other unvisited nodes based on the distance metric used for the graph.
3. Return the tour: The final tour is the sequence of nodes visited in the order they were selected during the algorithm.

The system appears to be a text-based AI assistant that processes natural language inputs and generates responses based on the input given. To ensure linearity in the size of the narrative input and the terminology, the system likely employs several techniques:

1. Tokenization: The system may break down the input text into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, phrases, or sentences. This allows the system to process the input in a more manageable and linear manner.
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER): The system may use NER to identify and extract specific entities such as names, locations, and organizations from the input text. This helps to reduce the complexity of the input and make it more linear.
3. Part-of-speech tagging: The system may use part-of-speech tagging to identify the grammatical categories of each word in the input text, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. This helps to understand the structure and meaning of the input text and make it",['The system scans the text word-by-word once and performs a voting task for each word.

165,Does the paper discuss limitations of considering only data from Twitter?,"[""We use a data set of Twitter users that contains all public messages for several million accounts, augmented with social network and geolocation metadata. This data set makes it possible to track, and potentially explain, every usage of a linguistic variable as it spreads through social media. Overall, we make the following contributions:Data\tTwitter is an online social networking platform. Users post 140-character messages, which appear in their followers' timelines. Because follower ties can be asymmetric, Twitter serves multiple purposes: celebrities share messages with millions of followers, while lower-degree users treat Twitter as a more intimate social network for mutual communication BIBREF13 . In this paper, we use a large-scale Twitter data set, acquired via an agreement between Microsoft and Twitter. This data set contains all public messages posted between June 2013 and June 2014 by several million users, augmented with social network and geolocation metadata.""
 'We also included the remaining users in our data set, but were not able to account for their geographical location.Researchers have previously shown that social network connections in online social media tend to be geographically assortative BIBREF29 , BIBREF30 . Our data set is consistent with this finding: for 94.8% of mutual-reply dyads in which both users were geolocated to one of the eight cities listed in sec:data-language, they were both geolocated to the same city. This assortativity motivates our decision to estimate separate influence parameters for local and non-local social connections (see sec:parametric-hawkes).Language Change as Social Influence\tOur main research goal is to test whether and how geographically distinctive linguistic markers spread through Twitter. With this goal in mind, our first question is whether the adoption of these markers can be viewed as a form of complex contagion. To answer this question, we computed the fraction of users who used one of the words listed in sec:data-language after being exposed to that word by one of their social network connections.'
 ""For example, lexical words are mainly transmitted through speech. We would expect their spread to be only weakly correlated with the Twitter social network. In contrast, abbreviations are fundamentally textual in nature, so we would expect their spread to correlate much more closely with the Twitter social network.Social network\tTo focus on communication between peers, we constructed a social network of mutual replies between Twitter users. Specifically, we created a graph in which there is a node for each user in the data set. We then placed an undirected edge between a pair of users if each replied to the other by beginning a message with their username. Our decision to use the reply network (rather than the follower network) was a pragmatic choice: the follower network is not widely available. However, the reply network is also well supported by previous research. For example, Huberman et al. argue that Twitter's mention network is more socially meaningful than its follower network: although users may follow thousands of accounts, they interact with a much more limited set of users BIBREF27 , bounded by a constant known as Dunbar's number BIBREF28 .""]","  Based on the information provided in the context, the paper does not explicitly discuss limitations of considering only data from Twitter. However, it is possible to infer some potential limitations of using only Twitter data.

Firstly, Twitter is a specific social media platform with its own unique features and user demographics, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other social media platforms or online communities. Additionally, the data set used in the study is limited to public messages posted by users between June 2013 and June 2014, which may not be representative of all Twitter users or time periods.

Furthermore, the study focuses on linguistic markers and their spread through social media, but it does not consider other forms of communication or online activities that may also influence language use. Finally, the study is based on a specific data set acquired from Microsoft and Twitter, which may have its own biases and limitations in terms of data quality, sampling, and representation of users.

In conclusion, while the paper provides valuable insights into the spread of linguistic markers on Twitter, it is important to consider potential limitations of using only Twitter data and to interpret the findings with caution when applying them to other",['Unacceptable'],0.4,0.9392772976952452,0.9999999999,0.0
166,Did they represent tie strength only as number of social ties in a networks? ,"['This difference may explain why we do not observe complex contagion for lexical words.Social Evaluation of Language Variation\tIn the previous section, we showed that geographically distinctive linguistic markers spread through Twitter, with evidence of complex contagion for phonetic spellings and abbreviations. But, does each social network connection contribute equally? Our second question is therefore whether (1) strong ties and (2) geographically local ties exert greater linguistic influence than other ties. If so, users must socially evaluate the information they receive from these connections, and judge it to be meaningful to their linguistic self-presentation. In this section, we outline two hypotheses regarding their relationships to linguistic influence.Tie Strength\tSocial networks are often characterized in terms of strong and weak ties BIBREF37 , BIBREF3 , with strong ties representing more important social relationships. Strong ties are often densely embedded, meaning that the nodes in question share many mutual friends; in contrast, weak ties often bridge disconnected communities. Bakshy et al. investigated the role of weak ties in information diffusion, through resharing of URLs on Facebook BIBREF38 . They found that URLs shared across strong ties are more likely to be reshared.'
 'They found that URLs shared across strong ties are more likely to be reshared. However, they also found that weak ties play an important role, because users tend to have more weak ties than strong ties, and because weak ties are more likely to be a source of new information. In some respects, language change is similar to traditional information diffusion scenarios, such as resharing of URLs. But, in contrast, language connects with personal identity on a much deeper level than a typical URL. As a result, strong, deeply embedded ties may play a greater role in enforcing community norms.We quantify tie strength in terms of embeddedness. Specifically, we use the normalized mutual friends metric introduced by Adamic and Adar BIBREF39 : $$s_{i,j} = \\sum _{k \\in \\Gamma (i) \\cap \\Gamma (j)} \\frac{1}{\\log \\left(\n\\#| \\Gamma (k)|\\right)},$$   (Eq.'
 '28) where, in our setting, $\\Gamma (i)$ is the set of users connected to $i$ in the Twitter mutual-reply network and $\\#|\\Gamma (i)|$ is the size of this set. This metric rewards dyads for having many mutual friends, but counts mutual friends more if their degrees are low—a high-degree mutual friend is less informative than one with a lower-degree. Given this definition, we can form the following hypothesis:The linguistic influence exerted across ties with a high embeddedness value $s_{i,j}$ will be greater than the linguistic influence exerted across other ties.Geographic Locality\tAn open question in sociolinguistics is whether and how local covert prestige—i.e., the positive social evaluation of non-standard dialects—affects the adoption of new linguistic forms BIBREF6 . Speakers often explain their linguistic choices in terms of their relationship with their local identity BIBREF40 , but this may be a post-hoc rationalization made by people whose language is affected by factors beyond their control.']","  Based on the information provided in the context, the answer is no. The researchers did not represent tie strength only as the number of social ties in a network. Instead, they used a metric called ""normalized mutual friends"" to quantify tie strength, which takes into account both the number of mutual friends and the degree of those friends. This metric rewards dyads for having many mutual friends, but counts mutual friends more if their degrees are low.",['Unacceptable'],1.0,0.696497585028212,0.49999999995,0.0

On NYT, a similar trend is observed: the improvement in the models with the document labels over LDA is obvious but not in the models with the word features. Given the number of the document labels (194 of AN and 545 of NYT), it is possible that the document labels already offer enough information and the word embeddings have little contribution in the two datasets.To test the hypothesis that the incorporation of meta information in MetaLDA can significantly improve the modelling accuracy in the cases where the corpus is sparse, we varied the proportion of documents used in training from 20% to 80% and used the remaining for testing. It is natural that when the proportion is small, the number of unseen words in testing documents will be large.'
 'In regard to MetaLDA, we fixed the matrices INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 output from the training procedure.

There are two strategies for handling unseen words for calculating perplexity on test documents: ignoring them or keeping them in computing the perplexity. Here we investigate both strategies:In this experiment, the perplexity is computed only on the words that appear in the training vocabulary.

170,Which other models that incorporate meta information do they compare against?,"['In addition, compared with other models using meta information, our model runs significantly faster.\tIntroduction\tWith the rapid growth of the internet, huge amounts of text data are generated in social networks, online shopping and news websites, etc. These data create demand for powerful and efficient text analysis techniques. Probabilistic topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) BIBREF0 are popular approaches for this task, by discovering latent topics from text collections. Many conventional topic models discover topics purely based on the word-occurrences, ignoring the meta information (a.k.a., side information) associated with the content. In contrast, when we humans read text it is natural to leverage meta information to improve our comprehension, which includes categories, authors, timestamps, the semantic meanings of the words, etc. Therefore, topic models capable of using meta information should yield improved modelling accuracy and topic quality.In practice, various kinds of meta information are available at the document level and the word level in many corpora. At the document level, labels of documents can be used to guide topic learning so that more meaningful topics can be discovered.'
 'Although with improved performance there still exists challenges for existing models: (1) for aggregation-based models, it is usually hard to choose which meta information to use for aggregation; (2) the “single topic” assumption makes DMM models lose the flexibility to capture different topic ingredients of a document; and (3) the incorporation of meta information in the existing models is usually less efficient.To our knowledge, the attempts that jointly leverage document and word meta information are relatively rare. For example, meta information can be incorporated by first-order logic in Logit-LDA BIBREF21 and score functions in SC-LDA BIBREF22 . However, the first-order logic and score functions need to be defined for different kinds of meta information and the definition can be infeasible for incorporating both document and word meta information simultaneously.The MetaLDA Model\tGiven a corpus, LDA uses the same Dirichlet prior for all the per-document topic distributions and the same prior for all the per-topic word distributions BIBREF23 .'

Given the number of the document labels (194 of AN and 545 of NYT), it is possible that the document labels already offer enough information and the word embeddings have little contribution in the two datasets.To test the hypothesis that the incorporation of meta information in MetaLDA can significantly improve the modelling accuracy in the cases where the corpus is sparse, we varied the proportion of documents used in training from 20% to 80% and used the remaining for testing. It is natural that when the proportion is small, the number of unseen words in testing documents will be large.']","  Based on the context information provided, the other models that incorporate meta information compared against in the study are:

Here we study whether or not the meta information helps MetaLDA improve topic quality, compared with other topic models that can also handle short texts. Table TABREF65 shows the NPMI scores on the three short text datasets. Higher scores indicate better topic coherence. All the models were trained with 100 topics. Besides the NPMI scores averaged over all the 100 topics, we also show the scores averaged over top 20 topics with highest NPMI, where “rubbish” topics are eliminated, following BIBREF22 . It is clear that MetaLDA performed significantly better than all the other models in WS and AN dataset in terms of NPMI, which indicates that MetaLDA can discover more meaningful topics with the document and word meta information.'
 'The original implementation was used. Following the paper, we set the number of pseudo documents to 1000 and INLINEFORM0 to 0.1.All the models, except where noted, the symmetric parameters of the document and the topic Dirichlet priors were set to 0.1 and 0.01 respectively, and 2000 MCMC iterations are used to train the models.Perplexity Evaluation\tPerplexity is a measure that is widely used BIBREF23 to evaluate the modelling accuracy of topic models. The lower the score, the higher the modelling accuracy. To compute perplexity, we randomly selected some documents in a dataset as the training set and the remaining as the test set. We first trained a topic model on the training set to get the word distributions of each topic INLINEFORM0 ( INLINEFORM1 ). Each test document INLINEFORM2 was split into two halves containing every first and every second words respectively. We then fixed the topics and trained the models on the first half to get the topic proportions ( INLINEFORM3 ) of test document INLINEFORM4 and compute perplexity for predicting the second half.'
 'Note that: (1) The scores on AN with 150 and 200 topics are not reported due to overfitting observed in all the compared models. (2) Given the size of NYT, the scores of 200 and 500 topics are reported. (3) The number of latent topics in LLDA must equal to the number of document labels. (4) For PLLDA, we varied the number of topics per label from 5 to 50 (2 and 5 topics on NYT). The number of topics in PPLDA is the product of the numbers of labels and topics per label.The results show that MetaLDA outperformed all the competitors in terms of perplexity on nearly all the datasets, showing the benefit of using both document and word meta information. Specifically, we have the following remarks:By looking at the models using only the document-level meta information, we can see the significant improvement of these models over LDA, which indicates that document labels can play an important role in guiding topic modelling.']","  Based on the given context information, the authors of the paper measure topic quality using the Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) score.

With two data augmentation techniques (i.e., the introduction of auxiliary variables), MetaLDA admits the local conjugacy and a close-form Gibbs sampling algorithm can be derived.

 'With both document and word meta information, MetaLDA still ran several times faster than DMR, LF-LDA, and WF-LDA.

This gains a significant improvement over others in terms of perplexity and topic quality. With two data augmentation techniques, MetaLDA enjoys full local conjugacy, allowing efficient Gibbs sampling, demonstrated by superiority in the per-iteration running time. Furthermore, without losing generality, MetaLDA can work with both regular texts and short texts. The improvement of MetaLDA over other models that also use meta information is more remarkable, particularly when the word-occurrence information is insufficient. As MetaLDA takes a particular approach for incorporating meta information on topic models, it is possible to apply the same approach to other Bayesian probabilistic models, where Dirichlet priors are used.']","  Based on the given context information, the authors of the paper use two data augmentation techniques in their proposed method, MetaLDA.

 ""Despite a more aggressive learning schedule, the performance of the augmented-data systems surpasses that of the baseline and pretrained models, even those trained on the largest ASR sets (150-hr Chinese and 300-hr English).For comparison to other work, Table TABREF16 (bottom) gives results for AST models trained on the full 160 hours of parallel data, including models with both pretraining and data augmentation. For the latter, we used the original learning schedule, but had to stop training early due to time constraints (after 15 days, compared to 8 days for complete training of the non-augmented 160h models). We find that both pretraining and augmentation still help, providing a combined gain of 3.8 (3.2) BLEU points over the baseline on the dev (test) set.Analyzing the models' representations\tFinally, we hope to gain some understanding into why pretraining on ASR helps with AST, and specifically how the neural network representations change during pretraining and fine-tuning.""

181,What languages did they use?,"['Each of the dev and test sets comprise 4.5 hours of speech.Experimental Setup ::: Pretraining data\tSince we focus on investigating factors that might affect the AST improvements over the baseline when pretraining, we have chosen ASR datasets for pretraining that contrast in the number of hours and/or in the language similarity with Spanish. Statistics for each dataset are in the left half of Table TABREF7, with further details below.To look at a range of languages with similar amounts of data, we used GlobalPhone corpora from seven languages BIBREF15, each with around 20 hours of speech: Mandarin Chinese (zh), Croatian (hr), Czech (cs), French (fr), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), and Swedish (sv). French and Portuguese, like the source language (Spanish), belong to the Romance family of languages, while the other languages are less related—especially Chinese, which is not an Indo-European language.'
 'GlobalPhone consists of read speech recorded using similar conditions across languages, and the transcriptions for Chinese are Romanized, with annotated word boundaries.To explore the effects of using a large amount of pretraining data from an unrelated language, we used the AISHELL-1 corpus of Mandarin Chinese BIBREF16, which contains 150 hours of read speech. Transcriptions with annotated word boundaries are available in both Hanzi (Chinese characters) and Romanized versions, and we built models with each. To compare to the GlobalPhone data, we also created a 20-hour subset of the Romanized AISHELL (zh-ai-small) by randomly selecting utterances from a subset of the speakers (81, roughly the number present in most of the GlobalPhone datasets).Finally, to reproduce one of the experiments from BIBREF4, we pre-trained one model using 300 hours of Switchboard English BIBREF17. This data is the most similar to the AST speech data in terms of style and channel (both are conversational telephone speech).'
 'In related work on multilingual pretraining for low-resource ASR, Adams et al. BIBREF10 showed that pre-training on more languages helps, but it is not clear whether the improvement is due to including more languages, or just more data.To begin to tease apart these issues, we focus here on monolingual pretraining for low-resource AST, and investigate two questions. First, can we predict what sort of pretraining data is best for a particular AST task? Does it matter if the pretraining language is related to the AST source language (defined here as part of the same language family, since phonetic similarity is difficult to measure), or is the amount of pretraining data (or some other factor) more important? Second, can pretraining be effectively combined with other methods, such as data augmentation, in order to further improve AST results?To answer these questions, we use the same AST architecture and Spanish-English parallel data as Bansal et al. BIBREF4, but pretrain the encoder using a number of different ASR datasets: the 150-hour AISHELL corpus of Chinese as well as seven GlobalPhone languages, each with about 20 hours of data.']","  Based on the given context information, the following languages were used in the experiment:

 'Undesirable psychological effects of abuse on individuals make it an important societal problem of our time. Munro munro2011 studied the ill-effects of online abuse on children, concluding that children may develop depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems as a result of their encounters online. Pew Research Center, in its latest report on online harassment BIBREF0 , revealed that INLINEFORM0 of adults in the United States have experienced abusive behavior online, of which INLINEFORM1 have faced severe forms of harassment, e.g., that of sexual nature. The report goes on to say that harassment need not be experienced first-hand to have an impact: INLINEFORM2 of American Internet users admitted that they stopped using an online service after witnessing abusive and unruly behavior of their fellow users. These statistics stress the need for automated abuse detection and moderation systems. Therefore, in the recent years, a new research effort on abuse detection has sprung up in the field of NLP.That said, the notion of abuse has proven elusive and difficult to formalize.

 'Second, it needs to capture abusive language, i.e., highlight instances of abuse if present, be they explicit (i.e., use of expletives) or implicit (e.g., dehumanizing comparisons). Third, it needs to identify the target(s) of abuse (or the absence thereof), be it an individual or a group. These properties align well with the categorizations of abuse we discussed in the introduction. They also aptly motivate the advances needed in the field: (1) developments in areas such as sarcasm detection and user profiling for precise segregation of abusive intent from humor, satire, etc.; (2) better identification of implicit abuse, which requires improvements in modeling of figurative language; (3) effective detection of generalized abuse and inference of target(s), which require advances in areas such as domain adaptation and conversation modeling.Conclusions\tOnline abuse stands as a significant challenge before society.

 'This categorization exposes some of the intricacies that lie within the task of automated abuse detection. While directed and explicit abuse is relatively straightforward to detect for humans and machines alike, the same is not true for implicit or generalized abuse.

Cyber-bullying is a classic example of directed and explicit abuse since there is typically a single target who is harassed with personal attacks.

187,How is abuse defined for the purposes of this research?,"['Different norms across (online) communities can affect what is considered abusive BIBREF1 . In the context of natural language, abuse is a term that encompasses many different types of fine-grained negative expressions. For example, Nobata et al. nobata use it to collectively refer to hate speech, derogatory language and profanity, while Mishra et al. mishra use it to discuss racism and sexism. The definitions for different types of abuse tend to be overlapping and ambiguous. However, regardless of the specific type, we define abuse as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group. Taking a course-grained view, Waseem et al. W17-3012 classify abuse into broad categories based on explicitness and directness. Explicit abuse comes in the form of expletives, derogatory words or threats, while implicit abuse has a more subtle appearance characterized by the presence of ambiguous terms and figures of speech such as metaphor or sarcasm. Directed abuse targets a particular individual as opposed to generalized abuse, which is aimed at a larger group such as a particular gender or ethnicity.'
 ""to better understand the content produced by them and make task-specific generalizations)? While we do not intend to provide answers to these questions within this survey, we hope that the above considerations can help to start a debate on these important issues.Labeling abuse. Labeling experiences as abusive provides powerful validation for victims of abuse and enables observers to grasp the scope of the problem. It also creates new descriptive norms (suggesting what types of behavior constitute abuse) and exposes existing norms and expectations around appropriate behavior. On the other hand, automated systems can invalidate abusive experiences, particularly for victims whose experiences do not lie within the realm of `typical' experiences BIBREF29 . This points to a critical issue: automated systems embody the morals and values of their creators and annotators BIBREF30 , BIBREF29 . It is therefore imperative that we design systems that overcome such issues. For e.g., some recent works have investigated ways to mitigate gender bias in models BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 .Abuse over time and across domains. New abusive words and phrases continue to enter the language BIBREF33 . This suggests that abuse is a constantly changing phenomenon.""
 ""In their study, Ross et al. ross stressed the difficulty in reliably annotating abuse, which stems from multiple factors, such as the lack of “standard” definitions for the myriad types of abuse, differences in annotators' cultural background and experiences, and ambiguity in the annotation guidelines. That said, Waseem et al. W17-3012 and Nobata et al. nobata observed that annotators with prior expertise provide good-quality annotations with high levels of agreement. We note that most datasets contain discrete labels only; abuse detection systems trained on them would be deprived of the notion of severity, which is vital in real-world settings. Also, most datasets cover few types of abuse only. Salminen et al. salminen2018anatomy suggest fine-grained annotation schemes for deeper understanding of abuse; they propose 29 categories that include both types of abuse and their targets (e.g., humiliation, religion).Feature engineering based approaches\tIn this section, we describe abuse detection methods that rely on hand-crafted rules and manual feature engineering.""]","  Based on the context information provided, abuse is defined in this research as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group.

The SMT approach yielded significant improvements in terms of TER, but was worse in terms of BLEU. Moreover, the NMT approach yielded worst results in terms of both BLEU and TER. Most likely, this results are due to having used the systems trained with El Quijote for modernizing El Conde Lucanor (see se:corp).When comparing the SMT and NMT approaches, we observe that SMT yielded the best results in all cases. This behavior was already perceived by BIBREF2 and is, most likely, due to the small size of the training corpora—a well-known problem in NMT. However, while the goal of modernization is making historical documents as easier to comprehend by contemporary people as possible, our goal is different.

For El Conde Lucanor, however, both approaches resulted in an increased of the effort need to generate an error-free modern version. This behavior was to be expected since the modernization quality for El Conde Lucanor was very low. Therefore, the system consistently generated wrong suffixes, resulting in the user having to make more corrections.Regarding the performance of both approaches, SMT achieved the highest effort reduction. This was reasonably expected since its modernization quality was better. However, in past neural IMT works BIBREF15, the neural IMT approach was able to yield further improvements despite having a lower translation quality than its SMT counterpart.'

 ""In our work, we focus on constraining our adversary to craft examples with semantic preservation and minimum perturbations to the input text.Given different settings of the adversary, there are other works that have designed attacks in “gray-box” settings BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. However, the definitions of “gray-box” attacks are quite different in each of these approaches. In this paper, we focus on “black-box” setting where we assume that the adversary possesses a limited set of labeled data, which is different from the target's training data, and also has an oracle access to the system, i.e., one can query the target classifier with any input and get its corresponding predictions. We propose an effective technique to generate adversarial examples in a black-box setting. We develop an Adversarial Example Generator (AEG) model that uses a reinforcement learning framing to generate adversarial examples. We evaluate our models using a word-based BIBREF11 and character-based BIBREF12 text classification model on benchmark classification tasks: sentiment classification and news categorization.""]","  Based on the provided context, the proposed reinforcement learning-based approach for generating adversarial examples in black-box settings involves using a self-critical approach to improve the Adversarial Example Generator (AEG) model. The AEG model is trained to generate adversarial examples that are semantics-preserving perturbations to the original text, while minimizing the number of perturbations and fooling the target classifier. The rewards are formulated based on the goals of fooling the target classifier, minimizing the number of perturbations, and preserving the semantics of the text. The approach is evaluated using word-based and character-based text classification models on benchmark classification tasks, such as sentiment classification and news categorization.",['Unacceptable'],1.0,0.9655793116287362,0.9999999999666667,0.0

For our experiments, we use only the response texts and assign a binary Fact or Feel label to each response: texts with score INLINEFORM0 1 are assigned to the fact class and texts with score INLINEFORM1 -1 are assigned to the feeling class. We did not use the responses with scores between -1 and 1 because they had a very weak Fact/Feeling assessment, which could be attributed to responses either containing aspects of both factual and feeling expression, or neither. The resulting set contains 3,466 fact and 2,382 feeling posts. We randomly partitioned the fact/feel responses into three subsets: a training set with 70% of the data (2,426 fact and 1,667 feeling posts), a development (tuning) set with 20% of the data (693 fact and 476 feeling posts), and a test set with 10% of the data (347 fact and 239 feeling posts).'
 'We define two thresholds: INLINEFORM0 to represent a minimum frequency value, and INLINEFORM1 to represent a minimum probability value. We found that using only a small set of patterns (when INLINEFORM2 is set to a high value) achieves extremely high precision, yet results in a very low recall. Instead, we adopt a strategy of setting a moderate probability threshold to identify reasonably reliable patterns, but labeling a text as factual or feeling only if it contains at least a certain number different patterns for that category, INLINEFORM3 . In order to calibrate the thresholds, we experimented with a range of threshold values on the development (tuning) data and identified INLINEFORM4 =3, INLINEFORM5 =.70, and INLINEFORM6 =3 for the factual class, and INLINEFORM7 =3, INLINEFORM8 =.55, and INLINEFORM9 =3 for the feeling class as having the highest classification precision (with non-trivial recall).The high-precision patterns are then used in the bootstrapping framework to identify more factual and feeling texts from the 11,561 unannotated posts, also from 4forums.com.'

 'Figure FIGREF15 captures the fact that there are 7,170 instances of the Adj Noun patterns, which comprise 17.8% of all patterns instances in the data set.For factual arguments, we see that patterns with prepositional phrases (especially NP Prep) and passive voice verb phrases are more common. Instantiations of NP Prep are illustrated by FC1, FC5, FC8, FC10 in Table TABREF13 . Instantiations of PassVP are illustrated by FC2 and FC4 in Table TABREF13 .

Almost every high probability pattern for feeling includes an adjective, as illustrated by every pattern except FE8 in Table TABREF13 . Figure FIGREF15 shows that three syntactic forms account for a large proportion of the instances of high-precision patterns in the data: Adj Noun, NP Prep, and ActVP.Next, we further examine the NP Prep patterns since they are so prevalent.

The purpose of this layer is to transform lexical representations to hidden contextual representations.'
 'Notably, the introduction of concatenation layer facilitates the inference and training of Hungarian layer.Training Hungarian Layer\tPreviously discussed, Hungarian algorithm is embedded into neural architecture, making a challenge for learning process. We tackle this issue by modifying the back-propagation algorithm in a dynamically graph-constructing manner. In the forward pass, we dynamically construct the links between Hungarian layer and the next layer, according to the aligned position pairs, while in the backward process, the back-propagation is performed through the dynamically constructed links. Next, we illustratively exemplify how the computational graph is dynamically constructed in Hungarian layer as Figure FIGREF13 shows.As Figure FIGREF13 shows, in the forward propagation, Hungarian algorithm works out the aligned position pairs, according to which, neural components are dynamically connected to the next layer. For the example of Figure FIGREF13 , the 1st source and 2nd target word representations are jointly linked to the 1st aligned position of concatenation layer.

In this paper, we reform the calculus graph as a dynamic process, which is guided by logic flow. Within our novel methodology, traditional algorithms could empower numerical neural network. Specifically, regarding the subject of sentence matching, we reformulate this issue as the form of task-assignment, which is solved by Hungarian algorithm.

The Hungarian layer is designed to dynamically construct the computational graph at every iteration, allowing for differentiable computation.

To answer your query, the authors do not explicitly mention ensuring differentiability everywhere in the architecture after adding the Hungarian layer. However, they do discuss the importance of differentiability in their methodology, stating that ""the back-propagation is performed through the dynamically constructed links"" (emphasis added). This suggests that the authors are aware of the need for differentiability in their proposed architecture and have taken steps to ensure it.

Furthermore, the use of a Hungarian layer, which is designed to perform alignment between sentences, implies that the architecture is intended to be differentiable everywhere. The Hungarian algorithm is a combinatorial optimization method that can be used to find the optimal assignment of entities to tasks, and it is typically applied in a differentiable manner.

However, it is not sufficient to alleviate the domain shift problem, because two potential limitations remain: 1) The joint model is not aware of the differences across domains, which would lead to poor performance on in-task evaluation since some task-specific features shared by other tasks. 2) Negative transferring might happened on new domains.'
 'This involves the tasks of multi-domain learning and domain adaptation. Here, we begin with several simple approaches for multi-domain summarization based on multi-domain learning.Multi-domain Summarization ::: Four Learning Strategies\tTo facilitate the following description, we first set up mathematical notations. Assuming that there are $K$ related domains, we refer to $D_k$ as a dataset with $N_k$ samples for domain $k$. $D_k = \\lbrace (S_i^{(k)},Y_i^{(k)})\\rbrace _{i=1}^{N_k}$, where $S_i^{(k)}$ and $Y_i^{(k)}$ represent a sequence of sentences and the corresponding label sequence from a document of domain $k$, respectively.'
 'Lastly, we additionally explore the effectiveness of meta-learning methods to get better generalization.

 'Among other media, Twitter is very popular for research and application purposes due to its scale, representativeness and ease of public access to its content. However, tweets, that are short messages of up to 140 characters, pose several challenges to traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems due to the creative use of characters and punctuation symbols, abbreviations ans slung language.Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental step for most of the information extraction pipelines. Importantly, the terse and difficult text style of tweets presents serious challenges to NER systems, which are usually trained using more formal text sources such as newswire articles or Wikipedia entries that follow particular morpho-syntactic rules. As a result, off-the-self tools trained on such data perform poorly BIBREF0 . The problem becomes more intense as the number of entities to be identified increases, moving from the traditional setting of very few entities (persons, organization, time, location) to problems with more. Furthermore, most of the resources (e.g., software tools) and benchmarks for NER are for text written in English.'

Therefore, having resources and benchmarks in other languages is crucial for enabling information access worldwide.In this paper, we propose a new benchmark for the problem of NER for tweets written in French.

225,Which dialogue data do they use to evaluate on?,"['Researchers have made attempts to improve automatic evaluation, trying methods such as adversarial evaluation BIBREF18, learning a scoring model BIBREF1, or a learnt ensemble of automatic metrics BIBREF19, but their value is as yet not fully understood.Currently the standard approach in chitchat dialogue is to perform human evaluations BIBREF2, BIBREF20, BIBREF21, BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF7, typically reporting a judgment such as conversation quality or appropriateness via a Likert scale or pairwise comparison. While conversations are naturally multi-turn, pairwise setups typically consider single turn evaluations, taking the “gold” dialogue history from human-human logs, and only consider altering a single utterance. A more complete multi-turn evaluation is typically measured with a Likert scale (usually 1-4 or 1-5) after the conversation takes place. Some works such as BIBREF6 ask a series of questions relating to different aspects of conversational ability. There are some notable variants from these standard setups.'
 'ACUTE-EVAL: Improved Dialogue Evaluation with Optimized Questions and Multi-turn Comparisons\tWhile dialogue remains an important end-goal of natural language research, the difficulty of evaluation is an oft-quoted reason why it remains troublesome to make real progress towards its solution. Evaluation difficulties are actually two-fold: not only do automatic metrics not correlate well with human judgments, but also human judgments themselves are in fact difficult to measure. The two most used human judgment tests, single-turn pairwise evaluation and multi-turn Likert scores, both have serious flaws as we discuss in this work.  ::: We instead provide a novel procedure involving comparing two full dialogues, where a human judge is asked to pay attention to only one speaker within each, and make a pairwise judgment. The questions themselves are optimized to maximize the robustness of judgments across different annotators, resulting in better tests. We also show how these tests work in self-play model chat setups, resulting in faster, cheaper tests. We hope these tests become the de facto standard, and will release open-source code to that end.\tIntroduction\tDialogue between human and machine is an important end-goal of natural language research.'
 'There are some notable variants from these standard setups. BIBREF22 provide a method that combines continuous scales and relative assessments, but in single-turn, rather than multi-turn evaluation. BIBREF19 compare human evaluations to automatic metrics computed on self-chats. Note that we also use self-chats in this work, but we evaluate these with humans, rather than automatic metrics.Finally, this work expands upon some of the ideas present in BIBREF6. In that work, a test for interestingness of a specificity-controlled model conducted with pairwise chat logs was mentioned, similar to the ones used here, but was not the focus of their work. In our work, we conduct a full study of novel variants of this approach, consider optimizing the questions for robust measurements over four types of questions, utilize self-chat logs in addition to human-bot logs, and benchmark state-of-the-art models across two recent tasks.Method: Acute-eval\tTo compare two dialogue models, model A and model B, our evaluation asks humans to directly compare side-by-side multi-turn dialogues conducted by these models.']","  Based on the given context information, the researchers use human-bot logs and self-chat logs to evaluate the performance of their dialogue models.",['Datasets from PersonaChat and Wizard of Wikipedia tasks.'],0.5,0.9062419639262841,0.3333333333,0.0
226,How much faster are pairwise annotations than other annotations?,"['If a worker fails to rate the human-human conversation as better, we remove their annotations from the results, in order to remove poor quality annotators. We additionally remove workers who never give a reason for their choice. Note that adding such worker quality tests to pairwise annotation tasks is straightforward where the gold annotation is known, while it is harder for Likert tests which have integer scores. One may also increase the number of quality-control annotations to decrease the likelihood of fraudulent workers, but we found using a single control question had a reasonable cost-noise ratio.Each specific pair of conversations is shown at most once, given that there are at least as many possible pairs of conversations as desired annotations. If there are more conversations available for each model than desired annotations, each conversation is shown at most once - that is, in only one annotation. We found that maximizing the diversity of pairs improved robustness of our evaluation across multiple replication experiments.Experiments\tWe perform experiments on two tasks, PersonaChat and Wizard of Wikipedia, which evaluate different aspects of conversational ability.'
 'In each trial, we show the annotator two whole conversations, with the second speaker in each conversation highlighted, as the judgment should be independent of the quality of the first speaker, see Figure FIGREF1. We then show a carefully worded question with two choices: speaker A or B, where the question measures a desired quality such as which speaker is more engaging, interesting or knowledgeable. Our experiments show that annotators perform well in this setup, and that our method can reveal subtle but significant differences between conversational models that other approaches, such as multi-turn Likert, cannot.Overall, our work provides the following contributions:A new evaluation method with a clear mechanism that provides fast, cheap iteration. This evaluation method allows efficient reuse of data from prior papers, allowing new models to be evaluated independently of baselines, and dramatically lowers the cost of annotation.We optimize question choices to find those with the highest agreement, increasing confidence in the desired test.'
 'The winning questions can then be used in future experiments by ourselves, and other researchers. Although having high inter-annotator agreement does not guarantee that crowdworkers interpret the question as intended, it increases the chance the question is understood uniformly. That is, the researcher still has to exercise care in the formulation of the question so that they believe it measures the quantity they are interested in. In our experiments we find questions with high-agreement rate over four axes: engagingness, interestingness, knowledge and humanness.Method: Acute-eval ::: Annotation Quality\tWe use crowdworkers for our annotations. We recommend limiting the number of annotations a single worker may complete to be only a few pairs (in our experiments, if we are making $N$ model comparisons then we allow $N$ annotations). In preliminary trials, we found that limiting the influence of any one worker was important for replicability, but that results were highly consistent across multiple runs with this limitation.Additionally, the first comparison any worker is asked to annotate consists of a conversation between a weak baseline model and human, and a human-human conversation.']","  Based on the provided context information, I can answer the query as follows:

Pairwise annotations are faster than other annotations because they require only a single conversation to be annotated, whereas other annotations may require multiple conversations or more complex questionnaires. This is due to the fact that pairwise annotations focus on comparing two specific conversations, rather than evaluating a single conversation or requiring a more extensive assessment of the conversational ability.

Additionally, the use of carefully worded questions with two choices (speaker A or B) allows for efficient and cost-effective evaluation, as it eliminates the need for multiple-turn Likert scales or open-ended responses. This approach also increases the chance that crowdworkers interpret the question as intended, as high-agreement rates can be achieved by optimizing question choices over four axes: engagingness, interestingness, knowledge, and humanness.

Overall, pairwise annotations offer a faster and more cost-effective approach to evaluating conversational ability compared to other annotation methods.",['by 5 times'],0.75,0.8939285165965024,0.49999999995,0.0

Recently, with the development of deep learning, deep neural networks have improved the performance of NER tasksBIBREF3BIBREF4. However, it may still be inefficient to use deep neural networks because the performance of these methods depends on the quality of labeled data in training sets while creating annotations for unstructured data is especially difficultBIBREF5. Therefore, researchers hope to find an efficient method to extract semantic and syntactic knowledge from a large amount of unstructured data, which is also unlabeled. Then, apply the semantic and syntactic knowledge to improve the performance of NLP task effectively.Recent theoretical developments have revealed that word embeddings have shown to be effective for improving many NLP tasks.

In contrast, there is no salient attention when the slot is not present in the input sentence.To analyze the impact of context, we compute the error rate with respect to span start position in the input sentence. Figure 4 shows that error rate tends to degrade for span start positions further from the beginning. This highlights opportunities to reduce a significant amount of errors by considering previous context.As shown in Figure 5 , our model makes more errors for longer spans. This can be improved by consulting spans detected by parsers or other span-based models such as coreference resolution systems BIBREF13 .Finally, we compute the percentage of POS tags that are tied to labeling errors.']","  Based on the provided context information, the improvement margin for ZAT (Zero-shot Adaptation with Translation) over LSTM-BoE (Long Short-Term Memory with Bootstrapped Embeddings) is statistically significant, with a mean improvement of $4.04$ , $5.37$ and $3.27$ points over LSTM-BoE with training size 500, 1000 and 2000, respectively.

 'The complete formula is listed in Fig. FIGREF5 .Unfolded NMT networks approximate but do not exactly match the output of the ensemble due to two reasons. First, the unfolded network synchronizes the attentions of the individual models. Each decoding step in the unfolded network computes a single attention weight vector. In contrast, ensemble decoding would compute one attention weight vector for each of the INLINEFORM0 input models. A second difference is that the ensemble decoder first applies the softmax at the output layer, and then averages the prediction probabilities. The unfolded network averages the neuron activities (i.e. the logits) first, and then applies the softmax function. Interestingly, as shown in Sec. SECREF4 , these differences do not have any impact on the BLEU score but yield potential speed advantages of unfolding since the computationally expensive softmax layer is only applied once.Shrinking the Unfolded Network\tAfter constructing the weight matrices of the unfolded network we reduce the size of it by iteratively shrinking layer sizes.

Using this measure, we fit a skewed Gaussian distribution over the ordered news articles, assigning INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 is the smoothed information content of INLINEFORM2 as drawn from the Gaussian.A difficult machine reading problem unique to noisy text sources, where the correct values may not be present in the cluster, is determining whether to predict any value at all. A common solution for handling such missing values is the use of a threshold, below which the model returns null. However, even a separate threshold for each slot would not fully capture the nature of the problem.Determining whether a value is missing is a trade-off between two factors: (1) how strongly the mention-level scores support a non-null answer, and (2) how much general information regarding that event and that slot is given. We incorporate both factors by extending the definition of INLINEFORM0 and its use in Eq. EQREF9 –Eq. to include not only mentions, but all words.'
 ""This is 14.9 points higher than Reschke's best system, and a statistically significant improvement over the unconstrained model (p INLINEFORM1 ). The improvements persist throughout training, as shown in Figure FIGREF52 .Additional iterations reduce performance. This effect is largely due to the constraint assumption not holding absolutely in the data. For instance, multiple slots can have the null value, and zero is common value for a number of slots. Running the constraint inference for a single iteration encourages a 1-to-1 mapping from values to slots, but it does not prohibit it. This result also implies that a hard heuristic decoding constraint time would not be as effective.Error Analysis\tWe randomly selected 15 development set instances which our best model predicts incorrectly. Of these, we find three were incorrectly labeled in the gold data as errors from the distance supervision hypothesis (i.e., “zero chance” being labeled for 0 survivors, when the number of survivors was not mentioned in the cluster), and should not be predicted. Six were clearly expressed and should be predictable, with highly correlated keywords present in the context window, but were assigned low scores by the model.""

We did not modify the aggregation weights ( INLINEFORM1 ) for the remaining documents, minimizing the effect of this approach.The EE-AS Reader has the lowest overall performance, which one can attribute to pooling evidence in a manner that is poorly suited to this problem domain.

 'In this section we describe (1) how the right aggregation method can better reflect how the gold labels are applied to the data, (2) how domain knowledge can be incorporated into aggregation, and (3) how aggregation can be used as a dynamic approach to identifying missing information.In the traditional view of distant supervision BIBREF9 , if a mention is found in an external knowledge base it is assumed that the mention is an expression of its role in the knowledge base, and it receives the corresponding label. This assumption does not always hold, and the resulting spurious labels are frequently cited as a source of training noise BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 . However, an aggregation over all mention scores provides a more accurate reflection of how distant supervision labels are applied to the data.If one were to assign a label to each mention and construct a loss using the mention-level scores ( INLINEFORM0 ) directly, it would recreate the hard labeling of the traditional distant supervision training scenario. Instead, we relax the distant supervision assumption by using a loss on the value-level scores ( INLINEFORM1 ), with aggregation to pool beliefs from one to the other.'

This baseline model is a simple and straightforward approach that does not take into account any additional information or interactions between users and items.",['Unacceptable'],0.33333333333333337,0.8704729999878477,0.0,0.0
255,Do they analyze which types of sentences/reviews are useful or not?,"[""In particular, reviews for users correspond to a diverse set of items that they have rated, resulting in notably heterogeneous textual contents with a variety of topics for different items. In contrast, each item's reviews are only about itself, and the contents are thus homogeneous in the sense that the topic is limited to a single narrow domain. For example, Fig. FIGREF1 shows several reviews from Amazon's health domain. User $u$'s historical reviews describe three items, Vitamin C, anti-inflammatory medication, and an air freshener, while all reviews for item $v$ are about itself, i.e., Vitamin D3.This profound difference necessitates distinct forms of attention to be paid on user reviews as opposed to item reviews, when deciding whether to recommend an item $v$ to a user $u$. To predict $u$'s preference of $v$, it is important to extract from $u$'s reviews those aspects that pertain most to $v$, e.g., comments on items that are similar to $v$. In contrast, from $v$'s reviews, we wish to account for the sentiment of other users with regard to relevant aspects of $v$.""
 ""To build an informative embedding for each review upon such sentences, we use a sentence-level attention network to aggregate the sentence embeddings $[{\\bf \\tilde{s}}_{1}^{v}, ..., {\\bf \\tilde{s}}_{k}^{v}]$ as follows, where the superscript $v$ is used to distinguish an item's notation from a user's notation.Here, $\\sum _{i=1}^{k}\\alpha _{i}^{v}=1$, and $\\alpha _{i}^{v}$ is the attention weight assigned to sentence ${\\bf \\tilde{s}}_{i}^{v}$. It quantifies the informativeness of sentence ${\\bf \\tilde{s}}_{i}^{v}$ with respect to $v$'s overall rating, compared to other sentences.""
 'That iswhere ${\\bf s}$ is the embedding of $s$ andwhere ${\\bf \\tilde{e}}_{0}$ is initialized by an all-zero vector ${\\bf 0}$.Suppose a review has $k$ sentences. We can then represent this review by a sequence $[{\\bf s}_{1}, ..., {\\bf s}_{k}]$, where ${\\bf s}_{i}$ is the embedding of the $i$-th sentence in the review, as inferred by Eq. (DISPLAY_FORM6). However, using Eq. (DISPLAY_FORM6), each ${\\bf s}_{i}$ only encodes its own semantic meaning, but remains oblivious of any contextual cues from its surrounding sentences in the same review.']","  Based on the given context information, it appears that the authors of the paper are analyzing the informativeness of different sentences in user reviews to determine which ones are most useful for predicting a user's preference for an item. They use a sentence-level attention network to aggregate the sentence embeddings and assign attention weights to each sentence based on its informativeness with respect to the item's overall rating. The authors do not explicitly mention analyzing the types of sentences or reviews that are useful or not, but rather focus on extracting relevant information from the reviews to make predictions.",['Unacceptable'],1.0,0.8600745920956752,0.99999999995,0.0
256,Which set of datasets do they use?,"['The $\\ell $ in Eq. (DISPLAY_FORM28) serves as our loss function for model training.Experiments\tIn this section, we evaluate our AHN model on several real datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art approaches.Experiments ::: Datasets\tWe conducted experiments on 10 different datasets, including 9 Amazon product review datasets for 9 different domains, and the large-scale Yelp challenge dataset on restaurant reviews. Table TABREF30 summarizes the domains and statistics for these datasets. Across all datasets, we follow the existing work BIBREF3, BIBREF17 to perform preprocessing to ensure they are in a $t$-core fashion, i.e., the datasets only include users and items that have at least $t$ reviews. In our experiments, we evaluate the two cases of $t=5$ and $t=10$. For the Yelp dataset, we follow BIBREF3 to focus on restaurants in the AZ metropolitan area. For each dataset, we randomly split the user–item pairs into $80\\%$ training set, $10\\%$ validation set, and $10\\%$ testing set.'
 ""FIGREF33, we observe that AHN generally gains more on the 10-core datasets, with absolute gains of up to $11.6\\%$ (DeepCoNN), $7.0\\%$ (D-ATT), $13.8\\%$ (MPCN), and $8.4\\%$ (HUITA). This suggests that the more reviews each user and item has, the more important it is to perform proper attention learning on relevant reviews and sentences on both the user and item sides.Experiments ::: Case Study\tWe next investigate the interpretability of AHN. Fig. FIGREF43(a) and (b) show the attention weights of AHN on the top three reviews of a pair of user and item on the Health dataset, where the item is a sleep aid medicine. In each of the user's reviews, the highlighted words indicate the item described by the review. As can be seen, the first two items “krill oil” and “pain relief patch” are more relevant to the item “sleep aid medicine” than the “laundry detergent” in the lowest-weighted review.""
 'Typically, they associate users with the respective sets of reviews they have written, while associating each item with the set of all reviews that have been written for it. To predict the rating for an unseen user–item pair, in a first step, the embeddings of that user and item are inferred from the respective sets of reviews via a neural network. Then, the two embeddings are matched to predict a numeric rating between them. For example, DeepCoNN BIBREF1 relies on convolutional neural networks to learn user (item) embeddings, and on a factorization machine BIBREF5 to predict ratings. D-ATT BIBREF3 uses dual-attention based networks to learn embeddings, and a simple dot product to predict ratings.Despite the encouraging progress, existing methods all regard the set of reviews by a user and the set of reviews for an item as the same type of documents, and invoke the same model (or even a shared model) to process them in parallel. In reality, however, the set of reviews for a user is fundamentally different from the set of reviews for an item.']","  Based on the provided context information, the set of datasets used in the experiment is:

We created templates (Table TABREF6 ) that contained both neutral and offensive nouns and adjectives inside the vocabulary (See Table TABREF7 ) to retain balance in neutral and abusive samples.For the evaluation metric, we use 1) AUC scores on the original test set (Orig. AUC), 2) AUC scores on the unbiased generated test set (Gen. AUC), and 3) the false positive/negative equality differences proposed in BIBREF1 which aggregates the difference between the overall false positive/negative rate and gender-specific false positive/negative rate. False Positive Equality Difference (FPED) and False Negative Equality Difference (FNED) are defined as below, where INLINEFORM0 .'
 'BIBREF13 shows the effectiveness of measuring and correcting gender biases in co-reference resolution tasks. We later show how we extend a few of these works into ours.Sexist Tweets (st)\tThis dataset consists of tweets with sexist tweets collected from Twitter by searching for tweets that contain common terms pertaining to sexism such as “feminazi.” The tweets were then annotated by experts based on criteria founded in critical race theory. The original dataset also contained a relatively small number of “racist” label tweets, but we only retain “sexist” samples to focus on gender biases. BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , the creators of the dataset, describe “sexist” and “racist” languages as specific subsets of abusive language.Abusive Tweets (abt)\tRecently, BIBREF4 has published a large scale crowdsourced abusive tweet dataset with 60K tweets. Their work incrementally and iteratively investigated methods such as boosted sampling and exploratory rounds, to effectively annotate tweets through crowdsourcing.'
 'For gender swapping data augmentation, we use pairs identified through crowd-sourcing by BIBREF13 .After identifying the degree of gender bias of each dataset, we select a source with less bias and a target with more bias. Vocabulary is extracted from training split of both sets. The model is first trained by the source dataset. We then remove final softmax layer and attach a new one initialized for training the target. The target is trained with a slower learning rate. Early stopping is decided by the valid set of the respective dataset.Based on this criterion and results from Section SECREF13 , we choose the abt dataset as source and st dataset as target for bias fine-tuning experiments.Results & Discussions\tTables TABREF12 and TABREF14 show the bias measurement experiment results for st and abt, respectively. As expected, pre-trained embeddings improved task performance. The score on the unbiased generated test set (Gen. ROC) also improved since word embeddings can provide prior knowledge of words.However, the equality difference scores tended to be larger when pre-trained embeddings were used, especially in the st dataset.']","  Based on the provided context information, the following metrics are used to measure gender biases:

266,What is the Ritter dataset?,"['Due to their terse nature, such noisy data often lack enough context, which poses a challenge to the correct identification of named entities. To address this issue we have presented and evaluated a novel approach using the Ritter dataset, showing consistent results over state-of-the-art models without using any external resource or encoded rule, achieving an average of 0.59 F1. The results slightly outperformed state-of-the-art models which do not rely on encoded rules (0.49 and 0.54 F1), suggesting the viability of using the produced metadata to also boost existing NER approaches. A further important contribution is the ability to handle single tokens and misspelled words successfully, which is of utmost importance in order to better understand short texts. Finally, the architecture of the approach and its indicators introduce potential to transparently support multilingual data, which is the subject of ongoing investigation.Acknowledgments\tThis research was supported in part by an EU H2020 grant provided for the HOBBIT project (GA no. 688227) and CAPES Foundation (BEX 10179135).'

 'The major advantages of this approach are: 1) the fact that there are no hand-crafted rules encoded; 2) the ability to handle misspelled words (because the search engine alleviates that and returns relevant or related information) and incomplete sentences; 3) the generic design of its components, allowing multilingual processing with little effort (the only dependency is the POS tagger) and straightforward extension to support more NER classes (requiring a corpus of images and text associated to each desired NER class, which can be obtained from a Knowledge Base, such as DBpedia, and an image dataset, such as METU dataset). While initial results in a gold standard dataset showed the potential of the approach, we also plan to integrate these outcomes into a Sequence Labeling (SL) system, including neural architectures such as LSTM, which are more suitable for such tasks as NER or POS.

Furthermore, “town” being correctly biased to LOC (0.7). The algorithm also suggests that the compound “paris hilton” is more likely to be a PER instead (0.7) and updates (correctly) the previous predictions. As a downside in this example, the algorithm misclassified “toast” as LOC. However, in this same example, Stanford NER annotates (mistakenly) only “paris” as LOC.

The main drawback is the performance of those models with noisy data, such as Tweets. A major reason is that they rely heavily on hand-crafted features and domain-specific knowledge.
